It was established to promote peace and diplomacy following the First World War and has since played a pivotal role in shaping the study of international relations and development. A Swiss government-accredited institution of higher education, the Graduate Institute became independent from the University of Geneva in 2016. It now offers master's and doctoral programs in areas such as international law, political science, international economics, and international affairs. It also hosts many research centers and initiatives. The institute is known for its interdisciplinary approach and its close proximity to international organizations, including the United Nations, fostering a dynamic environment for research and policy-oriented scholarship. </p>
