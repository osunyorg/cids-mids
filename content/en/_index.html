        <p>The MIDS is more than an academic program, for you it will also be a personal journey. Discovering a new city, new areas of law, new methodologies, new perspectives. But you are not alone on this journey: you are joined by other like-minded students from all over the world. For a year, your cohort will be a family and a unique support-network. When you graduate, you also join the larger MIDS community.Â </p>
