            <p><i><b>David Roney, Partner</b>, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva</i></p><p><i><b>Tanya Landon, Partner</b>, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva</i></p><p>Among the aptitudes that are most sought after in the domain of international dispute settlement is the capacity to display excellent writing skills: the ability to express arguments clearly and logically in concise sentences, to build convincing lines of reasoning, to identify the central theme of a case for focus and direction, to tell compelling stories and to capture the imagination of decision-makers. While some lawyers are naturals in legal writing, most take a longer route to master it. This workshop aims to formalize and theorize what makes good writing, and train participants to apply these rules and tricks in practice.</p>

            <p><i><b>Birgit Sambeth Glasner</b>, Partner, Altenburger LTD Legal + Tax, Geneva</i></p><p>During this workshop, a respected international commercial mediator, accredited by the most prominent ADR organizations worldwide as well as ICSID Conciliator &amp; Mediator, will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest based negotiation? What is the context and how does the mediation process unfold? How do you prepare it most efficiently? How to structure multi-party hybrid processes such as Arb-Med-Arb, Dispute Boards, MEDALOA? How does an Investor-State mediation work? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsels and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties interests.<br></p>

        <p>Elective courses provide students with the opportunity to explore topics beyond the core and intensive courses, allowing for deeper engagement in areas related to international dispute settlement or adjacent fields. These semester-long, weekly courses are drawn from the regular curricula of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) Law Faculty and the Graduate Institute, Geneva (IHEID), and take place on the respective institution’s campus.</p><p>Each year, the MIDS pre-selects 20 to 30 elective courses based on their relevance and compatibility with the MIDS schedule. Students are required to take at least two electives as part of the MIDS curriculum, and by the end of the year, they have the option to substitute one elective with an internship experience to count toward their graduation requirements (see Internship Experience below).</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Note that the list of elective courses offered varies from one year to another, depending on changes made to their curriculum by our parent institutions. Admitted students will receive an updated list in due time. </p><p><b>That being said, you can learn more about the subjects addressed in elective courses in previous years on the <a href="https://mids.ch/en/academics/thematics/#specific-areas-of-interest">thematics</a> page.</b></p>

        <p>The thesis is a carefully argued scholarly paper presenting an original argument that is well substantiated with primary and secondary sources. The thesis includes a substantial research component and must deal with a topic that falls within the scope of international dispute settlement. It must be written under the guidance of an academic supervisor, chosen from the faculty leading the Core Courses, Intensive Courses, or Elective Courses. Being the final element of the MIDS LL.M. program, the thesis gives the students an opportunity to demonstrate expertise in the chosen area.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education by substituting one elective course with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements. Internships may take place at a law firm or institution specializing in international dispute settlement. The internship experience component of the curriculum allows students to explore their individual interests while gaining practical, hands-on experience that enhances their learning outcomes.</p><p>The MIDS maintains robust connections with a wide range of employers, including law firms, international organizations, and arbitral institutions, and many networking opportunities are built into the MIDS curriculum. MIDS career services support students in their internship search, as well as throughout the application and interview process with individualized coaching; the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program.</p><p>A valid internship experience may be comprised of one or more internship commitments, totaling between three to twelve months. Students are required to maintain their student status, extending their graduation timeline for an additional year. Students must obtain approval for their internship plans from the MIDS and comply with any necessary work permit requirements.</p>

        <p>The MIDS Academic Retreat is a two-day event focused on a moot court exercise in international arbitration. Students, divided into teams, prepare and present oral arguments under time pressure, guided by experienced coaches. The exercise sharpens skills in legal analysis, strategy, oral advocacy, and teamwork. Hearings are held before tribunals of experienced arbitration practitioners. In addition to enhancing professional skills, the retreat provides valuable opportunities for networking and socializing with peers and professionals.</p>
