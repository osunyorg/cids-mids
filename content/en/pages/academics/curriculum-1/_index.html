        <p>The MIDS combines a curriculum common to all students, providing them with key, foundational knowledge, alongside a modular curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in, delivered in a variety of formats throughout the year, catering to students' needs and preferences. The unique strength of the MIDS is also to offer a large number of complementary learning opportunities and to have the goal of professional development built into the program.</p><p><b>As such, more than an ordinary graduate program, the MIDS is more of a comprehensive learning and professionalization journey.</b><br></p>
