        <p>The MIDS is an intensive program in every sense. An average week includes about 20 hours of in-person courses, each of which requires thorough preparation—typically two to three hours per hour of class time.</p><p>Our teaching approach prioritizes active engagement in the classroom, where students are expected to share opinions, discuss peer perspectives, and respond to required readings.</p><p>In the autumn semester, the two core courses follow a regular weekly schedule, while the remaining components (spring core courses, workshops, tutorials, lectures, seminars, study trips, conferences, etc.) vary in timing.</p><p>The MIDS schedule is designed with flexibility to accommodate the availability of in-demand faculty and to integrate exciting new opportunities at short notice. No two weeks look alike.</p><p>The program demands total commitment, rewarding students with a transformative experience where hard work truly pays off.</p>
