The total internship experience may be between three and twelve months, occurring between the end of exams in mid-June to the end of September the following year.</p>  <p> A Week at the MIDS  <br>   <br>The MIDS is an intensive program in every sense. An average week includes about 20 hours of in-person courses, each of which requires thorough preparation—typically two to three hours per hour of class time. Our teaching approach prioritizes active engagement in the classroom, where students are expected to share opinions, discuss peer perspectives, and respond to required readings. In the autumn semester, the two core courses follow a regular weekly schedule, while the remaining components (spring core courses, workshops, tutorials, lectures, seminars, study trips, conferences, etc.) vary in timing. The MIDS schedule is designed with flexibility to accommodate the availability of in-demand faculty and to integrate exciting new opportunities at short notice. No two weeks look alike. The program demands total commitment, rewarding students with a transformative experience where hard work truly pays off.</p>  <p> Curriculum Structure  <br>  The MIDS program offers a comprehensive and extensive curriculum. To help you navigate the program, we organize it into three categories: Core Curriculum, Modular Curriculum, and Enrichment Curriculum. <br>Core Curriculum <br>The core curriculum provides a foundation of essential knowledge and skills that all students must acquire, ensuring a consistent learning experience across the cohort. The core curriculum includes: - 5 Core Courses and their  tutorials - 4 Core Workshops</p>  <p>Modular Curriculum <br>The modular curriculum allows students to tailor their learning experience, fostering a personalized academic journey and deepening their expertise in areas that matter most to them. The Modular Curriculum includes: -  7 Intensive Courses (minimum requirement) - 2 Elective Courses  (minimum requirement) - the LL.M. Thesis Some students may also participate in an  Internship Experience  for credit.</p>  <p>Enrichment Curriculum <br>The enrichment curriculum offers a diverse range of additional activities meant to broaden students' perspectives, experiences, and skills, complementing their core and modular studies. The enrichment curriculum includes: - An academic retreat featuring a mini-moot court - Compact workshops - International Study Trips - Conferences - Lectures and seminars</p>  <p>Career Services <br>Finally, the career services offered to students throughout the year are considered an integral part of the MIDS program. The career services offer a range of activities including: - Workshops - Individual counseling - Networking opportunities</p>  <p> Curriculum Elements at a Glance  <br> What makes up the MIDS curriculum?  <br>Core Curriculum <br>The core curriculum provides a foundation of essential knowledge and skills that all students must acquire, ensuring a consistent learning experience across the cohort.</p>  <p>Modular Curriculum <br>The modular curriculum allows students to tailor their learning experience, fostering a personalized academic journey and deepening their expertise in areas that matter most to them.
