        <p>The MIDS combines a curriculum common to all students, providing them with key, foundational knowledge, alongside a modular curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in, delivered in a variety of formats throughout the year, catering to students' needs and preferences. The unique strength of the MIDS is also to offer a large number of complementary learning opportunities and to have the goal of professional development built into the program.</p><p><b>As such, more than an ordinary graduate program, the MIDS is more of a comprehensive learning and professionalization journey.</b><br></p>

        <p>The MIDS is an intensive program, in every sense. An average week comprises about 20 hours of in-person courses, for which students must thoroughly prepare in advance (approximately two to three hours of preparation per hour of class time).</p><p>The MIDS teaching system requires an active classroom, where students are called on to express their opinions, discuss the views expressed by classmates, and comment on required readings.</p><p>In the autumn semester, the two core courses take place on a regular schedule of once per week, but the rest of the program components (spring core courses, workshops, tutorials, lectures, seminars, study trips, conferences, etc.) do not follow a regular pattern.</p><p>The flexibility of the MIDS schedule allows for quick adaption to the schedules of our in-demand faculty, and the possibility to add in exciting new opportunities at short notice. No two weeks look alike at the MIDS.</p><p>The MIDS requires total commitment, and the result is a transformative experience where working hard pays off.</p>
