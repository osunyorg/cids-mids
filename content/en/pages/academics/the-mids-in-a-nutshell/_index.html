        <p>The MIDS combines a curriculum common to all students, providing them with key, foundational knowledge, alongside a modular curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in, delivered in a variety of formats throughout the year, catering to students' needs and preferences. The unique strength of the MIDS is also to offer a large number of complementary learning opportunities and to have the goal of professional development built into the program.</p><p><b>As such, more than an ordinary graduate program, the MIDS is more of a comprehensive learning and professionalization journey.</b><br></p>

        <p>The MIDS is an intensive program. An average week comprises about 20 hours of in-class courses for which students have to thoroughly prepare in advance (2 to 3 hours of preparation for hour of class is a good estimate).</p><p>The MIDS teaching system requires an active class, where students are called on to express their opinions, discuss the views expressed by classmates and comment on required readings.</p><p>Some courses take place every week at the same time and day, but many of the other activities (workshops, lectures, seminars, conferences, study trips, networking events,…) do not follow a regular pattern and they are scattered throughout the program. That is why no two weeks look alike at MIDS.</p><p>Our students should be prepared to fully commit themselves. MIDS is a transformative experience where working hard pays off.</p>
