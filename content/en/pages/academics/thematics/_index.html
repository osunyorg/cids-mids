            Fundamentals of international dispute settlement

          description: >-
            <p>Across the core curriculum's different modules, MIDS students learn about the variety and complexity of dispute resolution mechanisms, but also about the key consistent features of international dispute settlement questions that arise across the spectrum of forms dispute resolution can take in practice--whether it is inter-state disputes before international courts or international commercial arbitration etc.<br></p>

            Public International Law

          description: >-
            <p>Although it is not always known, a good international dispute settlement lawyer must have strong foundations in public international law. Throughout the program, and irrespective of what careers they intend to undertake, students therefore strengthen and further their knowledge and understanding of most key and transversal issues of public international law that often arise in practice. </p>

            Comparative Law

          description: >-
            <p>Alongside international law as such, the practice of international dispute settlement today requires a solid understanding of what domestic legal frameworks provide. By focusing on the English, French, and Swiss systems, the core curriculum exposes students to different approaches and gives them the tools to understand any other legal system they may encounter in their career.<br></p>

            International Dispute Settlement Bodies and Procedures

          description: >-
            <p>While international disputes can be resolved before a wide range of bodies, private, public, international, regional, or domestic, the MIDS curriculum makes sure that students acquire a robust knowledge and understanding of the role and operation of today's key international bodies, from the International Court of Justice to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce, and even the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. </p>

        <p>In addition to the foundational knowledge needed for all international dispute settlement lawyers, the unique and elaborate MIDS curriculum gives students many opportunities to specialize in the areas that interest them most, but also to expand their horizons by learning about new issues or new areas and perhaps discover a new passion.</p><p>This is the purpose of the <b>modular curriculum</b>, as part of which <b>intensive courses</b> as well as <b>elective courses</b> let students choose among dozens of different subjects. </p><p>Additionally, by selecting a topic of their choice for their <b>LL.M. thesis</b>, and by deciding whether and where to undertake an <b>internship experience</b>, students get a chance to learn by doing and to solidify their expertise.<br></p><p><b>In the past years, students have been able to gain expertise in some of the areas listed below.</b></p>
