  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The MIDS program offers a unique opportunity for students to pursue a double degree with the National University of Singapore (NUS). Established in 2017, the Double Degree Program (DDP) enables students to earn both the LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) and the NUS LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (IADR). Students who complete the curriculum at either MIDS or NUS with an IADR specialization can enroll in the other institution for an additional (third) consecutive semester. Upon successfully finishing their studies in both locations, students graduate with both the MIDS and NUS LL.M. degrees.</p>  <p> About the National University of Singapore (NUS)  <br>   <br>NUS Law is widely regarded as Asia’s leading law school, known for its diverse and distinguished faculty. Committed to fostering a vibrant community, it promotes critical thinking on the fundamental issues of our interconnected world. Located in Singapore—a long-established commercial hub—NUS Law embraces a global perspective in legal education. Its curriculum has incorporated comparative, international, and multi-disciplinary approaches, enriched by visiting faculty and students from around the globe, creating a dynamic and cosmopolitan atmosphere.</p>  <p> Program Structure: the MIDS to NUS Pathway  <br>   <br>The Double Degree Program permits MIDS students who have completed the curriculum for the MIDS to spend a semester at NUS Law, enrolled in the LL.M.
