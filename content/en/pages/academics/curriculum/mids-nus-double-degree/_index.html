        <p>The MIDS program offers a unique opportunity for students to pursue a double degree with the National University of Singapore (NUS). Established in 2017, the Double Degree Program (DDP) enables students to earn both the LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) and the NUS LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (IADR). Students who complete the curriculum at either MIDS or NUS with an IADR specialization can enroll in the other institution for an additional (third) consecutive semester. Upon successfully finishing their studies in both locations, students graduate with both the MIDS and NUS LL.M. degrees.<br></p>
