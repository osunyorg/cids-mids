        <p>The unique strength of the MIDS is the combination of a common curriculum providing students with key, foundational knowledge, and a personalized curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in. Finally, the third pillar is formed by a set of "special activities" that allow for students to gain exposure to real-life aspects of the operation, in practice, of international dispute settlement.</p>

        <p>The groundwork of the curriculum consists of two general courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of international dispute settlement. The first course, held during the first semester, sets the stage and explains the different mechanisms for resolving international disputes. The second discusses the main procedural issues that arise in international legal proceedings.</p>

        <p>This course covers the main procedural issues arising in the inter­ national legal proceedings examined in the first general course. As the procedures in the different dispute resolution processes raise similar issues (e.g. jurisdiction, provisional remedies, equaltreatment, evidence, enforcement), this course reviews these aspects with an eye to comparisons and contrasts.</p>

        <p>Tutorials are intrinsically connected to the general courses. Inspired by the Oxford tutorial system, tutorials are weekly interactions between a tutor and a group of ten students. Tutorials serve two different purposes. On the one hand, they provide an opportunity for a revisit and more detailed exploration and illustration of the key concepts addressed in the general courses. On the other, in every tutorial session a student presents a research paper which is discussed with all participants.</p><p>Students are expected to participate actively during tutorials, not only in the discussion of the issues covered by the general courses, but also on the research papers presented by their classmates.</p>

            The New York Convention of 1985

            <p>PROF. ALBERT JAN VAN DEN BERG, Emeritus Professor of Law, Erasmus University (Rotterdam); Visiting Professor, Georgetown Law School (Washington DC), Tsinghua School of Law (Beijing), and University of Miami School of Law; Partner, Hanotiau &amp; van den Berg (Brussels) The New York Convention of 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards is the single most important legal text in international agreements and arbitral awards. Students taking the New York Convention of 1958 course obtain a unique insight into the application of the Con­vention and into the great challenges it faces to keep current with the world of arbitration as it has evolved since 1958. Indeed, since the publication in 1981 of his classical treatise “The New York Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Judicial Interpretation”, Professor Albert Jan van den Berg has been widely rec­ognized as the worldwide expert on the topic. See also his website: www.newyorkconvention.org</p>

It raises many issues that in part receive divergent answers under different arbitration laws. This course explores these issues in depth, including the notion of separability of the arbitration agreement and the principle of competence­competence that play a fundamental role in the theory and practice of international commercial arbitration.</p>

            Financial Damage Analysis - Expert Witness Perspectives

          description: >-
            <p>GEOFFREY SENOGLES, Partner, Senogles &amp; Co, Chartered Accountants, Switzerland Any lawyer working in arbitration, whether as counsel, arbitrator or arbitral secretary, will undoubtedly be faced with quantum issues. The goal of this series of workshops is to provide an insight into financial damage expertise and methodologies from the perspective of a practicing forensic accountant who has testified on well over 50 occasions as financial expert witness in international proceedings (e.g. at ICSID, ICJ, ICC, Iran­US Claims Tribunal, TAS/CAS Lausanne, High Court in London etc. etc.) and previously dealt with financial aspects of mass claims while on staff at the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC). Our first workshop concentrates our whole attention on the role, obligations, pressures and perspectives of an expert witness.</p>

            Mediation

          description: >-
            <p>BIRGIT SAMBETH, Partner, Altenburger Ltd legal+tax A respected international commercial mediator will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? When are they ready to do so? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest based negotiation? What is the context and how does the mediation process unfold? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsel and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties.</p>
