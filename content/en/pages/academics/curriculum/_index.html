        <p>The unique strength of the MIDS is the combination of a common curriculum providing students with key, foundational knowledge, and a personalized curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in. Finally, the third pillar is formed by a set of "special activities" that allow for students to gain exposure to real-life aspects of the operation, in practice, of international dispute settlement.</p>

        <p>This course offers the foundations of substantive law for international commercial arbitration. It explores the law of international commercial contracts from a comparative and transnational perspective, within the frame of the procedural and the conflicts-of-laws challenges of international arbitration. This course is not about encyclopedic knowledge of the law(s) of international contracts but understanding first principles and being able to construct solid arguments founded thereon. Solid knowledge of your own domestic contract law is required.</p>

        <p>Among the aptitudes that are most sought after in the domain of international dispute settlement is the capacity to display excellent writing skills: the ability to express arguments clearly and logically in concise sentences, to build convincing lines of reasoning, to identify the central theme of a case for focus and direction, to tell compelling stories and to capture the imagination of decision-makers. While some lawyers are naturals in legal writing, most take a longer route to master it. This workshop aims to formalize and theorize what makes good writing, and train participants to apply these rules and tricks in practice.</p>

        <p>During this workshop, a respected international commercial mediator, accredited by the most prominent ADR organizations worldwide as well as ICSID Conciliator &amp; Mediator, will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest based negotiation? What is the context and how does the mediation process unfold? How do you prepare it most efficiently? How to structure multi-party hybrid processes such as Arb-Med-Arb, Dispute Boards, MEDALOA? How does an Investor-State mediation work? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsels and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties interests.</p>

        <p>FIAA is a Geneva-based foundation widely recognized as the world’s leading provider of advocacy training for international arbitration. Based on our longstanding partnership, FIAA provides MIDS students with an intensive two-day workshop on witness examination in international arbitration. Through a combination of lectures, demonstrations and, most importantly, small group learning-by-doing exercises, MIDS students have a unique opportunity to learn and put into practice critically important advocacy skills and techniques, all of which has proven to dramatically improve the oral advocacy skills of each and every student.</p>

            Financial Damage Analysis - Expert Witness Perspectives

          description: >-
            <p>GEOFFREY SENOGLES, Partner, Senogles &amp; Co, Chartered Accountants, Switzerland Any lawyer working in arbitration, whether as counsel, arbitrator or arbitral secretary, will undoubtedly be faced with quantum issues. The goal of this series of workshops is to provide an insight into financial damage expertise and methodologies from the perspective of a practicing forensic accountant who has testified on well over 50 occasions as financial expert witness in international proceedings (e.g. at ICSID, ICJ, ICC, Iran­US Claims Tribunal, TAS/CAS Lausanne, High Court in London etc. etc.) and previously dealt with financial aspects of mass claims while on staff at the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC). Our first workshop concentrates our whole attention on the role, obligations, pressures and perspectives of an expert witness.</p>

            Mediation

          description: >-
            <p>BIRGIT SAMBETH, Partner, Altenburger Ltd legal+tax A respected international commercial mediator will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? When are they ready to do so? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest based negotiation? What is the context and how does the mediation process unfold? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsel and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties.</p>

            Witness Examination in International Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p>FIAA – Foundation for International Arbitration Advocacy FIAA is a Geneva­based foundation widely recognized as providing the world’s best clinical training in arbitration advocacy. Based on our longstanding partnership, FIAA provides MIDS students with an intensive two­day workshop on witness examination in international arbitration. Through a com­ bination of lectures, demonstrations and, most importantly, small group learning­by­doing exercises, MIDS students have a unique opportunity to learn and put into practice critically important advocacy skills and techniques, all of which has proven to dramatically improve the oral advocacy skills of each and every student.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education by substituting one elective course with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements. Internships may take place at a law firm or institution specializing in international dispute settlement. The internship experience component of the curriculum allows students to explore their individual interests while gaining practical, hands-on experience that enhances their learning outcomes.</p><p>The MIDS maintains robust connections with a wide range of employers, including law firms, international organizations, and arbitral institutions, and many networking opportunities are built into the MIDS curriculum. MIDS career services support students in their internship search, as well as throughout the application and interview process with individualized coaching; the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program.</p><p>A valid internship experience may be comprised of one or more internship commitments, totaling between three to twelve months. Students are required to maintain their student status, extending their graduation timeline for an additional year. Students must obtain approval for their internship plans from the MIDS and comply with any necessary work permit requirements.</p>
