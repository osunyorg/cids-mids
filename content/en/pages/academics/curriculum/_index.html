        <p>The core part of the curriculum consists of five compulsory courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of international dispute settlement.</p><p>In the first semester, the core courses provide a solid grounding in commercial and investment treaty arbitration.</p><p>In the second semester, they cover state-to-state dispute resolution and transnational and comparative contract law, as well as the national arbitration laws of three key jurisdictions (England, France and Switzerland).</p><p><i>“Core Courses” were previously called “General Courses.” The new nomenclature applies to the MIDS 2024-2025 cohort and onward.</i></p>

            International Commercial Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Thomas Schultz</b>, University of Geneva Law Faculty and Graduate Institute</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Autumn Semester</i></p><p>This course provides an advanced and broad introduction to international commercial arbitration, accessible to those who have limited or no understanding of it. Its approach leans more towards first principles and fundamentals than granular practical learning. It thus prepares the way for the heavily practice-focused and in-depth discussions of commercial arbitration that make up most of the rest of the MIDS program.</p>

        - title: >-
            Investment Treaty Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Zachary Douglas KC</b>, Geneva Graduate Institute; MIDS Program Director</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Rukmini Das</p><p><i>Autumn Semester</i></p><p>This course provides the fundamentals of investment treaty arbitration, both in terms of its procedural aspects (by contrasting the special features of investment arbitration with commercial arbitration and state/state procedures) and the substantive obligations of investment protection.  The course focuses on the issues that have given rise to controversy in the jurisprudence, and students will be encouraged to explore their own views on the key debates.</p>

        - title: >-
            State-to-State Dispute Settlement

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Makane Moïse Mbengue</b>, University of Geneva Law Faculty</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>This course will explore the main aspects of the law and practice of interstate dispute settlement mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and interstate arbitration before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). The course will deal in particular with issues such as access to these interstate mechanisms, bases of jurisdiction, provisional measures, counter-claims, third-party intervention, use of experts and advisory jurisdiction.</p>

            The Law of International Commercial Contracts

          description: >-
            <p><b>Dr. Jan Kleinheisterkamp</b>, Visiting Professor in Practice, LSE Law School; Arbitrator and Mediator</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Rukmini Das</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>This course offers the foundations of substantive law for international commercial arbitration. It explores the law of international commercial contracts from a comparative and transnational perspective, within the frame of the procedural and the conflicts-of-laws challenges of international arbitration. This course is not about encyclopedic knowledge of the law(s) of international contracts, but understanding first principles and being able to construct solid arguments founded thereon. Solid knowledge of your own domestic contract law is required.</p>

            English, French and Swiss Arbitration Law

          description: >-
            <p><i>This Core Course is taught by three faculty members:</i></p><ul> <li>English Arbitration Law: <b>Professor Stavros Brekoulakis</b>, Michael &amp; Laura Hwang Chair in International Arbitration, National University of Singapore &amp; Member of 3 Verulam Buildings (Gray’s Inn)</li> <li>French Arbitration Law: <b>Professor Maximin de Fontmichel,</b> Professor of Private Law, Director of the Master in International Arbitration and Business Law (MACI), Université Paris-Saclay</li> <li>Swiss Arbitration Law: <b>Franz X. Stirnimann Fuentes</b>, Principal Partner at Stirnimann Fuentes</li> </ul><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturers Dr. Rukmini Das and Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>In this course, the national arbitration laws of three important jurisdictions will be critically assessed, with a particular emphasis on the practice and procedure for the challenge of arbitral awards before the national courts. This will facilitate a close comparison between the approaches taken by the legislature and the courts to the oversight of the arbitral process.</p>

            Legal Writing

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>David Roney</b>, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva </i></p><p><i><b>Tanya Landon</b>, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva</i></p><p>Among the aptitudes that are most sought after in the domain of international dispute settlement is the capacity to display excellent writing skills: the ability to express arguments clearly and logically in concise sentences, to build convincing lines of reasoning, to identify the central theme of a case for focus and direction, to tell compelling stories and to capture the imagination of decision-makers. While some lawyers are naturals in legal writing, most take a longer route to master it. This workshop aims to formalize and theorize what makes good writing, and train participants to apply these rules and tricks in practice.</p>

            Mediation

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>Birgit Sambeth</b>, Partner, Altenburger LTD Legal + Tax, Geneva</i></p><p>During this workshop, a respected international commercial mediator, accredited by the most prominent ADR organizations worldwide as well as ICSID Conciliator &amp; Mediator, will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest-based negotiation? What is the context, and how does the mediation process unfold? How do you prepare it most efficiently? How to structure multi-party hybrid processes such as Arb-Med-Arb, Dispute Boards, MEDALOA? How does an Investor-State mediation work? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsels and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties' interests.</p>

Two highly experienced international practitioners deliver this workshop series.</p>

            Advocacy in International Arbitration: Questioning of Fact Witnesses in International Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><i>Organized by the Foundation for International Arbitration Advocacy (FIAA)</i></p><p>FIAA is a Geneva-based foundation widely recognized as the world’s leading provider of advocacy training for international arbitration. Based on our longstanding partnership, FIAA provides MIDS students with an intensive two-day workshop on witness examination in international arbitration. Through a combination of lectures, demonstrations and, most importantly, small group learning-by-doing exercises, MIDS students have a unique opportunity to learn and put into practice critically important advocacy skills and techniques, all of which has proven to dramatically improve the oral advocacy skills of each and every student.</p>

            Arbitration of Intellectual Property &amp; Technology Disputes

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>   Professor Jacques   de Werra</b>, Professor and Director of the Digital Law Center, Faculty of Law, University of Geneva</i></p><p>In the knowledge economy, intangible assets, technology and data (that can be protected by intellectual property rights [IP]) are of strategic importance for the competitiveness of companies and of countries. This has unsurprisingly led to an increase of international IP and technology disputes. Arbitration has emerged as a privileged way to solve such disputes. On this basis, the goal of this intensive course is to present and discuss the use of arbitration for solving IP &amp; technology disputes in the light of recent trends and of potential future developments.</p>

            <p><i><b>   Professor Jane   Willems</b>, Associate Director, IADS International Arbitration and Dispute Settlement Program and Visiting Professor, Tsinghua University</i></p><p>This course introduces the trends and fundamental legal concepts underlying domestic and international commercial arbitration in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. It starts with the legal framework and the institutional organizations active in the field. It then turns, relying on a comparative approach of arbitral and judicial practice, to the main characteristics of commercial arbitration in the region, underlying (i) the enforcement of agreements for arbitration ; (ii) the commencement and conduct of arbitration proceedings ; and (iii) recourse against arbitral awards as well as enforcement of arbitral awards.</p>

            Contract Law in International Commercial Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>   Professor Patricia   Saiz</b>, ESADE Law School, Arbitrator</i></p><p>Every dispute that gives rise to a commercial arbitration arises out of a contract and calls for the tribunal to apply and interpret such contract. How do arbitrators deal with contract issues? Taught by an experienced arbitration practitioner, member of the ICC International Court of Arbitration and professor of international commercial and investment arbitration, this course reviews topics that are recurrent before arbitral tribunals, including interpretation, default and termination, liability, waivers and limitations to liability, force majeure and changed circumstances, and damages.</p>

        - title: >-
            Dispute Settlement Mechanisms for Environmental and Climate Change Disputes

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>   Professor Laurence   Boisson de Chazournes</b>, University of Geneva</i></p><p>Environmental and climate change disputes at the international level are on the rise, frequently being litigated before various types of dispute resolution mechanisms.  The specific contours of these disputes with respect to common interests, risk prevention or intergenerational equity deserve special attention.  This course will focus on the dispute settlement mechanisms (ICJ, arbitration, investment arbitration as well as specialized means) which are available as well as the procedural tools that can be employed, for example, resorting to expert evidence, provisional measures or counter-claims. </p>

        - title: >-
            Ethics in International Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><b>   Professor Catherine   Rogers</b></p><p>This course explores the professional obligations of the primary participants in international arbitration—arbitrators, lawyers, experts, institutions, tribunal secretaries, and third-party funders. Despite international arbitration’s impressive growth and obvious maturation in recent years, many unanswered questions remain about the applicable ethical duties and professional conduct of these participants in arbitral processes. During this highly interactive course, students will develop practical, conceptual, and theoretical frameworks for resolving ethical questions that arise in their practice, and an ability to anticipate the conduct-related issues that may affect their clients’ rights and their professional obligations.</p>

            <p><i><b>   Professor Mamadou   Hebié, </b>Associate Professor of international law, Leiden Law School; Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration</i></p><p>Provisional measures raise several difficult questions for the judges and arbitrators having to decide on their request. This is true not only with regard to the conditions to be met in order to indicate them, but also with regard to the impact the decision may have in the following steps of the procedure (jurisdiction, merits). This intensive course will critically assess the case law of inter-State courts and tribunals, as well as that of investor-State arbitration.</p>

This course aims at analysing the participation of African states in the shaping of universal mechanisms such as ICSID in particular. It will also show how specific procedures for the settlement of investment disputes have been put in place within the African continent, for instance through African regional courts and at the level of the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Last but not least, the course will emphasise on-going reforms and proposals in Africa with respect to investment arbitration.</p>

            Reform of Investor-State Dispute Settlement

          description: >-
            <p><b>   Professor Gabrielle   Kaufmann-Kohler</b></p><p>At the same time as it grew exponentially, investment arbitration started attracting increasingly vocal criticism especially about the lack of transparency, consistency and legitimacy. This course seeks to understand where investment arbitration comes from, what the profound reasons for the current critiques and concerns are, and why they are raised now. It then focuses on the reform initiatives that are presently ongoing, be it through treaty drafting, rules amendments by institutions, such as ICSID, and most importantly through the UNCITRAL reform process. Should investment arbitration be abolished in favor of national courts, or mediation? Should it be replaced by an investment court? Or supplemented by a permanent appellate mechanism? Should it be simply improved? How? Answering these questions will allow to reflect on the purpose of international dispute settlement and on how to design a workable and fair justice system.</p>

            Sports Law and Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>Dr. Kendra Magraw</b>, former CAS Counsel</i></p><p>Switzerland is the host to several international sports federations, as well as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). CAS acts as the world’s highest sports tribunal for many types of disputes (such as disciplinary, eligibility, anti-doping and commercial disputes) for many major sports and sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup. Like many types of international arbitration, the number of sports arbitrations has skyrocketed in recent years. Students taking Sports Law and Arbitration will be introduced to the concept of lex sportiva and the different procedures before CAS, as well as hot topics in international sports arbitration. </p>

            The Arbitration Agreement in International Commercial Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>   Professor Sébastien   Besson,</b> Partner, Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler</i></p><p>The arbitration agreement is the cornerstone of international commercial arbitration. It raises complex theoretical issues that have direct practical consequences. This course explores these issues in depth, including the enforcement of the arbitration agreement, the contents of the arbitration agreement (including so-called “pathological” arbitration agreements), the laws governing arbitration agreements, the notion of separability and the principle of competence-competence, the scope of the arbitration agreement and arbitrability. The course has a comparative law dimension and examines the relevant international treaties and some selected domestic arbitration laws.</p>

Program, University of Miami School of Law; Visiting Professor, Georgetown University Law Center (Washington DC), National University of Singapore Faculty of Law and Tsinghua University Law School (Beijing); Partner, Hanotiau &amp; van den Berg (Brussels)</i></p><p>The New York Convention of 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards is the single most important legal text in international agreements and arbitral awards. Students taking the New York Convention of 1958 course obtain a unique insight into the application of the Convention and into the great challenges it faces to keep current with the world of arbitration as it has evolved since 1958. </p>

            Theoretical and Practical Aspects of International Commercial Arbitration Involving States and State Entities

          description: >-
            <p><b>   Professor Eduardo   Silva Romero</b></p><p>The decline, political or otherwise, of investment arbitration has caused an explosion in the use of international commercial arbitration to resolve investment disputes.  States and State entities, however, have always had confidence in the international commercial arbitration system.  The statistics and works of the ICC International Court of Arbitration support this proposition.  It is, as a result, timely and relevant to examine anew the theoretical and practical aspects of this classical type of arbitration when used by private parties, on the one hand, and States and State entities, on the other.  In particular, (i) notions such as subjective arbitrability, the prohibition to rely on the State’s internal law to escape the effects of an international commercial arbitration agreement, the applicable law to State contracts, and (ii) practical issues such as the drafting of the arbitration agreement, the formation of the tribunal, the transparency of the proceedings, and the enforcement of the award in those cases, among many other notions and practical questions, should be reassessed.</p>

            WTO Dispute Settlement

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>   Professor Gabrielle   Marceau,</b> Geneva University; Senior Counsellor, WTO Research Division (ERSD)</i></p><p>This course focuses on how the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO operates from a legal, political and diplomatic perspective. In reviewing the procedural steps of actual disputes, including the use of experts, the retaliation stage, together with alternative means of settling disputes, the students will be able to better understand how States and other international actors can address international economic tensions resulting from societal choices, while pursuing the WTO goals of both fighting illegitimate protectionism and protecting legitimate public policy objectives. It will also help understand the context of the suspension of the Appellate Body's activities and the calls for specific or general reforms in the WTO, and its dispute settlement system.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education by substituting one elective course with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements. Internships may take place at a law firm or institution specializing in international dispute settlement. The internship experience component of the curriculum allows students to explore their individual interests while gaining practical, hands-on experience that enhances their learning outcomes.</p><p>The MIDS maintains robust connections with a wide range of employers, including law firms, international organizations, and arbitral institutions, and many networking opportunities are built into the MIDS curriculum. MIDS career services support students in their internship search, as well as throughout the application and interview process with individualized coaching; the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program.</p><p>A valid internship experience may be comprised of one or more internship commitments, totaling between three to twelve months. Students are required to maintain their student status, extending their graduation timeline for an additional year. Students must obtain approval for their internship plans from the MIDS and comply with any necessary work permit requirements.</p>
