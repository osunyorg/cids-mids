        <p>The core part of the curriculum consists of five compulsory courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of international dispute settlement.</p><p>In the first semester, the core courses provide a solid grounding in commercial and investment treaty arbitration.</p><p>In the second semester, they cover state-to-state dispute resolution and transnational and comparative contract law, as well as the national arbitration laws of three key jurisdictions (England, France and Switzerland).</p><p><i>“Core Courses” were previously called “General Courses.” The new nomenclature applies to the MIDS 2024-2025 cohort and onward.</i></p>

      elements:
        - title: >-
            International Commercial Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Thomas Schultz</b>, University of Geneva Law Faculty and Graduate Institute</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Autumn Semester</i></p><p>This course provides an advanced and broad introduction to international commercial arbitration, accessible to those who have limited or no understanding of it. Its approach leans more towards first principles and fundamentals than granular practical learning. It thus prepares the way for the heavily practice-focused and in-depth discussions of commercial arbitration that make up most of the rest of the MIDS program.</p>

        - title: >-
            Investment Treaty Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Zachary Douglas KC</b>, Geneva Graduate Institute; MIDS Program Director</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Rukmini Das</p><p><i>Autumn Semester</i></p><p>This course provides the fundamentals of investment treaty arbitration, both in terms of its procedural aspects (by contrasting the special features of investment arbitration with commercial arbitration and state/state procedures) and the substantive obligations of investment protection.  The course focuses on the issues that have given rise to controversy in the jurisprudence, and students will be encouraged to explore their own views on the key debates.</p>

        - title: >-
            State-to-State Dispute Settlement

          description: >-
            <p><b>Professor Makane Moïse Mbengue</b>, University of Geneva Law Faculty</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>This course will explore the main aspects of the law and practice of interstate dispute settlement mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and interstate arbitration before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). The course will deal in particular with issues such as access to these interstate mechanisms, bases of jurisdiction, provisional measures, counter-claims, third-party intervention, use of experts and advisory jurisdiction.</p>

        - title: >-
            The Law of International Commercial Contracts

          description: >-
            <p><b>Dr. Jan Kleinheisterkamp</b>, Visiting Professor in Practice, LSE Law School; Arbitrator and Mediator</p><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturer Dr. Rukmini Das</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>This course offers the foundations of substantive law for international commercial arbitration. It explores the law of international commercial contracts from a comparative and transnational perspective, within the frame of the procedural and the conflicts-of-laws challenges of international arbitration. This course is not about encyclopedic knowledge of the law(s) of international contracts, but understanding first principles and being able to construct solid arguments founded thereon. Solid knowledge of your own domestic contract law is required.</p>

        - title: >-
            English, French and Swiss Arbitration Law

          description: >-
            <p><i>This Core Course is taught by three faculty members:</i></p><ul> <li>English Arbitration Law: <b>Professor Stavros Brekoulakis</b>, Michael &amp; Laura Hwang Chair in International Arbitration, National University of Singapore &amp; Member of 3 Verulam Buildings (Gray’s Inn)</li> <li>French Arbitration Law: <b>Professor Maximin de Fontmichel,</b> Professor of Private Law, Director of the Master in International Arbitration and Business Law (MACI), Université Paris-Saclay</li> <li>Swiss Arbitration Law: <b>Franz X. Stirnimann Fuentes</b>, Principal Partner at Stirnimann Fuentes</li> </ul><p>Assisted by MIDS Lecturers Dr. Rukmini Das and Dr. Mohamed Mahayni</p><p><i>Spring Semester</i></p><p>In this course, the national arbitration laws of three important jurisdictions will be critically assessed, with a particular emphasis on the practice and procedure for the challenge of arbitral awards before the national courts. This will facilitate a close comparison between the approaches taken by the legislature and the courts to the oversight of the arbitral process.</p>

            Legal Writing

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>David Roney</b>, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva </i></p><p><i><b>Tanya Landon</b>, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP, Geneva</i></p><p>Among the aptitudes that are most sought after in the domain of international dispute settlement is the capacity to display excellent writing skills: the ability to express arguments clearly and logically in concise sentences, to build convincing lines of reasoning, to identify the central theme of a case for focus and direction, to tell compelling stories and to capture the imagination of decision-makers. While some lawyers are naturals in legal writing, most take a longer route to master it. This workshop aims to formalize and theorize what makes good writing, and train participants to apply these rules and tricks in practice.</p>

            Mediation

          description: >-
            <p><i><b>Birgit Sambeth</b>, Partner, Altenburger LTD Legal + Tax, Geneva</i></p><p>During this workshop, a respected international commercial mediator, accredited by the most prominent ADR organizations worldwide as well as ICSID Conciliator &amp; Mediator, will take students through the nuts and bolts of mediation: When should parties settle? How to bring them to a settlement through a facilitated interest-based negotiation? What is the context, and how does the mediation process unfold? How do you prepare it most efficiently? How to structure multi-party hybrid processes such as Arb-Med-Arb, Dispute Boards, MEDALOA? How does an Investor-State mediation work? These are some of the key questions in mediation; they require special skills, which are too often ignored by counsels and arbitrators alike, much to the detriment of the parties' interests.</p>

            <p><i><b>Geoffrey Senogles</b>, Chartered Accountant; Partner, Senogles &amp; Co, Switzerland</i></p><p><i><b>Patricia Saiz</b>, Arbitrator; Professor, ESADE Law School</i></p><p>Any lawyer working in arbitration has to engage with the evaluation of damages.</p><p>The goal of this two-part workshop is to provide an insight into the world of damages, from the different perspectives of a lawyer and an expert witness.  The content covers relevant legal and financial concepts, as well as international arbitration practice. Two highly experienced international practitioners deliver this workshop series.</p>

            Advocacy in International Arbitration: Questioning of Fact Witnesses in International Arbitration

          description: >-
            <p><i>Organized by the Foundation for International Arbitration Advocacy (FIAA)</i></p><p>FIAA is a Geneva-based foundation widely recognized as the world’s leading provider of advocacy training for international arbitration. Based on our longstanding partnership, FIAA provides MIDS students with an intensive two-day workshop on witness examination in international arbitration. Through a combination of lectures, demonstrations and, most importantly, small group learning-by-doing exercises, MIDS students have a unique opportunity to learn and put into practice critically important advocacy skills and techniques, all of which has proven to dramatically improve the oral advocacy skills of each and every student.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education by substituting one elective course with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements. Internships may take place at a law firm or institution specializing in international dispute settlement. The internship experience component of the curriculum allows students to explore their individual interests while gaining practical, hands-on experience that enhances their learning outcomes.</p><p>The MIDS maintains robust connections with a wide range of employers, including law firms, international organizations, and arbitral institutions, and many networking opportunities are built into the MIDS curriculum. MIDS career services support students in their internship search, as well as throughout the application and interview process with individualized coaching; the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program.</p><p>A valid internship experience may be comprised of one or more internship commitments, totaling between three to twelve months. Students are required to maintain their student status, extending their graduation timeline for an additional year. Students must obtain approval for their internship plans from the MIDS and comply with any necessary work permit requirements.</p>
