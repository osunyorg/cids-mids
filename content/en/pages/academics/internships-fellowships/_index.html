        <p>By virtue of an agreement between the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the MIDS, one student each year has the opportunity to join the PCA’s Secretariat after they have completed all the mandatory modules, participating for a period of twelve months in the work of the PCA’s International Bureau.</p><p>The PCA is an intergovernmental organization with 122 Contracting Parties that have acceded to one or both of the PCA’s founding conventions. Established in 1899 to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution between States, the PCA has developed into a modern, multifaceted institution meeting the dispute resolution needs of the international community.</p><p>The PCA's Secretariat - the International Bureau - consists of an experienced team of legal and administrative staff of various nationalities. It is headed by its Secretary-General. The bureau provides administrative support to tribunals and commissions, serving as the official channel of communications and ensuring safe custody of documents. The International Bureau provides services such as financial administration, logistical and technical support for meetings and hearings, travel arrangements, and general secretarial and linguistic support. It also provides administrative support to tribunals or commissions conducting PCA dispute settlement proceedings outside The Netherlands.<br></p>
