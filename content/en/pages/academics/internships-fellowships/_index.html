    <p>  <br>Internships and fellowships offer an exciting opportunity for MIDS students to enhance their practical skills in the field of international arbitration.  Because we recognize the importance of hands-on experience as part of the MIDS training, our students can utilize internship experiences to  count towards their graduation requirements .</p>  <p> Internships  <br>   <br>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements. Students are encouraged to explore internship opportunities throughout the year, supported by MIDS career services that provide individualized coaching during the search, application, and interview processes. Additionally, many networking opportunities are integrated into the MIDS curriculum. The MIDS has established partnerships with law firms and international institutions, allowing students to participate in internships with these organizations each year. While the internship application process can be daunting, the support provided by MIDS helps the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program. Internship experiences typically range from three to twelve months, occurring from mid-June to the end of September the following year. Most internship experiences require a one-year extension of the MIDS student status.</p>  <p> MIDS students regularly participate in internships with the following organizations, among many others in Geneva, Zürich, Paris, London, Brussels, Madrid, and beyond: </p>  <p>Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>LALIVE <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Schellenberg Wittmer <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Sidley <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Three Crowns LLP <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Latham & Watkins <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Dechert <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Hogan Lovells <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Rothorn Legal <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Hanotiau & van den Berg <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Wordstone Dispute Resolution <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p>Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) <br>https://mids.ch/404</p>  <p> PCA Fellowship  <br>   <br>The MIDS program and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) established an Assistant Legal Counsel Fellowship program in 2016.
