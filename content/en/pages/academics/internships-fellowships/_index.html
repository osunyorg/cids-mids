        <p>The MIDS program offers students the opportunity to enhance their education with an internship experience, which is counted towards their graduation requirements.</p><p>Students are encouraged to explore internship opportunities throughout the year, supported by MIDS career services that provide individualized coaching during the search, application, and interview processes. Additionally, many networking opportunities are integrated into the MIDS curriculum.</p><p>The MIDS has established partnerships with law firms and international institutions, allowing students to participate in internships with these organizations each year.</p><p>While the internship application process can be daunting, the support provided by MIDS helps the majority of students secure an internship before completing the program.</p><p>Internship experiences typically range from three to twelve months, occurring from mid-June to the end of September the following year. Most internship experiences require a one-year extension of the MIDS student status.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) established an Assistant Legal Counsel Fellowship program in 2016. By virtue of this agreement, each year, one MIDS graduate is selected to join the International Bureau of the PCA for a 12-month fellowship, based on their academic performance in the MIDS program. The fellowship is financially supported by the MIDS. </p>

      notes: >-
        <p><b>The Permanent Court of Arbitration</b></p><p>The PCA is an intergovernmental organization with 117 member states. Established in 1899 to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution between States, the PCA has developed into a modern, multifaceted institution meeting the dispute resolution needs of the international community.</p><p>The PCA's Secretariat - the International Bureau - consists of an experienced team of legal and administrative staff of various nationalities. It is headed by its Secretary-General. The bureau provides administrative support to tribunals and commissions, serving as the official channel of communications and ensuring safe custody of documents. The International Bureau provides services such as financial administration, logistical and technical support for meetings and hearings, travel arrangements, and general secretarial and linguistic support. It also provides administrative support to tribunals or commissions conducting PCA dispute settlement proceedings outside The Netherlands.</p>
