        <p>At the MIDS, we not only train students to become well-rounded international dispute settlement lawyers, we also help them build a professional network, we advise them, support them through application processes, and we equip them with the tools and knowledge needed to land the best possible job opportunities after graduation. Our methods are tried and true: approximately 80% of our students find a position before they graduate.</p><p>The field of international dispute settlement is competitive and difficult to break in, this is why, once you join us, whether you are eager to work with international law firms, arbitral institutions, international organizations, international courts, or in-house legal departments, the MIDS career services will be here to help you develop the skills and confidence required to succeed. Whether you are looking for a new opportunity or need coaching for an upcoming interview, we are here to help. </p><p>We also know that taking a year off from their career to do an LL.M. also requires sacrifices, and many students are eager to work as soon as they complete the program. Yet, planning their next professional move requires serious thinking and careful planning, which is why students have access to career services and support from day 1 and throughout their time at the MIDS.  </p>
