        <p>The MIDS career services provide current students and alumni with workshops and individual meetings on:</p><ul> <li>Career planning</li> <li>CV and cover letter drafting assistance and draft review</li> <li>Professional development of social media presence</li> <li>Networking skills coaching</li> <li>Mock interviews and after-interview debriefing sessions</li> </ul><p>MIDS students are made aware of the importance of thinking about their life after the MIDS from day one. On presentation day they are introduced to the career services at their disposal. That first week they also have a 45-minute individual meeting with the MIDS staff where they already discuss, together with their study plan at MIDS, their expectations for the life after the MIDS. This meeting helps MIDS staff to better understand the student profile in order to have an individual approach to each student’s career prospect.</p><p>Career services include a two-day workshop on how to draft a curriculum vitae and cover letter, how to have a professional presence on social media, how to do networking both online and in person, how to face a job interview, and how to strategically plan the professional career. Following the workshop, students count on individual feedback on their draft CVs and cover letters, individual coaching regarding job search strategy and applications for vacancies, and individual mock interviews in preparation for real ones together with after-interview feedback as well.</p><p>During the MIDS academic year students are exposed to numerous opportunities, in the form of networking events and job interviews, where they can make the most of the skills acquired through workshops and individual career counseling and training sessions.</p>
