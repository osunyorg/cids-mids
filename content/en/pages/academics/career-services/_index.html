        <p>At the MIDS, we not only train students to become well-rounded international dispute settlement practitioners, we also help them build a professional network and search for a job after the program. The MIDS equips our students with the tools they need to succeed in the international disputes market. Our proven methods yield results: approximately 80% of students find a position before they graduate.</p><p>Whether our students are searching for positions with an international law firm, arbitral institution, international organization, government, international court, or in-house legal at a company, MIDS career services are there to help students develop the skills and confidence to succeed.</p><p>We understand that pursuing an LL.M. for a year entails sacrifices, and many students are eager to begin their careers upon completing the program. However, planning the next professional step requires thoughtful consideration and careful strategy. That’s why students have access to career services and support from day one and throughout their time at MIDS.</p>
