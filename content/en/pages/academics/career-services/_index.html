Whether our students are searching for positions with an international law firm, arbitral institution, international organization, government, international court, or in-house legal at a company, MIDS career services are there to help students develop the skills and confidence to succeed.

That’s why students have access to career services and support from day one and throughout their time at MIDS.</p>  <p> What do we offer?  <br>   <br>The MIDS career services provide current students and alumni with workshops and individual support for:  <br> Career planning  <br> CV and cover letter drafting assistance and review  <br> Professional development of social media presence  <br> Networking skills coaching  <br> Mock interviews and after-interview debriefing sessions  <br> The MIDS also provides students with access to a vast professional network, consisting of more than 500 MIDS alumni as well as contacts within leading law firms, arbitral institutions, and professional organizations. During the MIDS academic year, students are exposed to numerous opportunities to connect and build their own network through networking events, professional workshops and industry panels. On these occasions, MIDS students can practice and make the most of the skills acquired through our careers workshops, training sessions, and individual career counseling.
