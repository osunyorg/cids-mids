    <p>  <br>"The MIDS was a wonderful experience, allowing me to immerse myself for a year in a stimulating environment where I was able to deepen my knowledge of international law and international trade law. ... I have also learned to look at problems from different angles." Pietro Acerbi, MIDS'10 "The MIDS was academically the most challenging thing I had done. I <br>had to spend a lot of time reading and catching up with legal concepts that <br>were unknown to me at that point. Nevertheless, it is still one of the most <br>rewarding experiences I have had. I would absolutely do it all over again!" Great Rios, MIDS'09 "My time at the MIDS was both intense, delightful, fun, and eye-opening" Sashia Diandra Anindita, MIDS'23 </p>  <p>"I chose the MIDS because it <br>is recognized as Europe's leading program in arbitration and dispute <br>resolution. And it proved worthy of its reputation: intense, demanding, and <br>absolutely transformative. Giovanna Martins Santana, MIDS'25</p>  <p>   <br>"The MIDS was an enriching and life/career-changing experience.... I was particularly pleased with the exposure to high-caliber arbitration practitioners and the multicultural environment of the program. The intra-MIDS moot court was perhaps my highlight of the program. Putting legal knowledge to test under a hearing-like environment was no easy task, but in my view it summed up the work of an arbitration practitioner and strengthened the ties among students as well." Yuri Mantilla, MIDS'12 "The MIDS not only paved the way to my current job in international arbitration in Switzerland; it also gave me access to a huge network of international disputes lawyers, many of whom I now call friends. It was a career and life-changing experience." Courtney Furner, MIDS'17 "What I experienced [at the MIDS] was so much more than an academic program. I truly grew as an individual." Sanskriti Sharma, MIDS'23 "This past year has been an <br>incredible journey. I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of <br>international dispute settlement while connecting with inspiring people from <br>all over the world."  <br> Ana Luisa Sousa, MIDS'25 </p>  <p>  </p>  <p> </p>  <p> "I applied to the MIDS hoping it would help me start a career in <br>international dispute settlement. The reality far exceeded my expectations; it <br>changed my life. I recommend it without reservation." Ndanga Kamau, MIDS'10 "The MIDS was an extremely valuable addition to my CV. It's a <br>degree that carries a lot of weight with law firms and <br>practitioners." </p>  <p> Vamika Puri, MIDS'21 "After one year of intense <br>classroom discussions, attending arbitration conferences, study trips and <br>lectures from leading practitioners... I can attest to the fact that it has <br>been one of the biggest privileges of my life to be part of this incredible <br>program."  <br> Shreyansh Jain, MIDS'25</p>  <p> </p>  <p>  </p>  <p> </p>  <p> "I not only gained invaluable knowledge and laid the basis for a <br>professional network at the MIDS: it also opened doors to a truly international <br>career and changed my life."</p>  <p> Anna Kozmenko, MIDS'09 "The small cohort ensured that interactions with instructors and <br>fellow students were always stimulating and enriching." <br> Aparna Nagabhushana, MIDS'23  <br> </p>  <p>  <br>"The past year has been the most challenging and rewarding journey of my <br>life, filled with humbling academic challenges, moments of self-doubt and <br>countless discussions that pushed me to grow. Every step was worth it, and I am <br>proud to now be part of the MIDS Alumni community. I am deeply grateful to my professors and classmates, who made this experience <br>not only intellectually enriching but also unforgettable on a personal <br>level."
