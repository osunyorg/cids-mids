            <p>When it was created in 2008, the MIDS was the first degree of its kind; a bold attempt at creating a niche and innovative program catering to the specific needs of the practice of international dispute settlement. Now, its stellar reputation with employers as well as academics, consistent student satisfaction, and successful alumni have made it a reference in the field.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program was established in September 2008 and today represents the principal teaching program of the CIDS. The program is jointly organized by the Faculty of Law of the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, covering a wide range of international dispute settlement mechanisms, including international commercial and investment arbitration, WTO dispute settlement, mediation, proceedings before various international courts and tribunals, and legal advocacy skills. Its comprehensive coverage makes it one of the few programs worldwide that encompasses all relevant aspects of the field, recognizing the connections and similarities that exist between most methods and mechanisms of international dispute settlement.</p><p>The MIDS is one of the top choices worldwide for postgraduate education in international arbitration and dispute resolution, offering full-time legal education to about 35 to 40 students annually. The program, which requires 90 ECTS credits, is designed for students who have already earned a complete law degree and are proficient in English, with most students possessing professional law experience.</p><p>The program structure is primarily elective, allowing students to pursue their specific interests in dispute settlement while ensuring that they acquire the essential knowledge of the field. The program is taught in English, with optional French courses also available.</p><p>Since its inception, the MIDS program has educated over 500 students from over 90 countries across all continents. Graduates of the program pursue careers in law firms, foreign affairs, trade or justice ministries, as legal officers in international dispute settlement institutions, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Some graduates also teach at various universities globally or pursue PhD studies following the MIDS.</p><p>The MIDS faculty consists of carefully selected experts from among the most respected academics and practitioners in the field of dispute settlement worldwide.</p>
