  body: >-
    <p>About the MIDS  <br>   <br>The MIDS program was established in September 2008 and today represents the principal teaching program of the Center for International Dispute Settlement (known as the CIDS). The program is jointly organized by the Faculty of Law of the University of Geneva and the Geneva Graduate Institute. The MIDS curriculum covers a wide array of international dispute settlement mechanisms, including international commercial and investment arbitration, WTO dispute settlement, mediation, proceedings before international courts and tribunals, and legal advocacy skills. The MIDS is one of the top choices worldwide for postgraduate education in international dispute resolution, offering full-time legal education to about 35 to 40 students annually. The program, which requires 90 ECTS credits, is designed for students who have already earned a complete law degree and are proficient in English, with most students possessing professional law experience. The program structure is primarily elective, allowing students to pursue their specific interests in dispute settlement while ensuring that they acquire the essential knowledge of the field. The program is taught entirely in English. Since its inception, the MIDS program has educated over 500 students from over 90 countries around the world. Graduates pursue careers in law firms, foreign affairs, trade or justice ministries, in international dispute settlement institutions, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Some graduates also go on to teach at universities or pursue PhD studies. The MIDS faculty consists of carefully selected experts from among the most respected academics and practitioners in the field of dispute settlement worldwide.</p>  <p> The CIDS  <br>The Center for International Dispute Settlement (CIDS) was established in 2016 as a collaborative effort between the Faculty of Law at the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. Its primary objectives include providing in-depth and executive education, promoting research, and contributing to public debates and activities in the field of international dispute settlement. <br>More information on the CIDS at  https://cids.ch/ .</p>  <p> Governance  <br>The day-to-day activities of the MIDS and the delivery of its pedagogical mission are overseen by the  MIDS Committee,  presided by the MIDS Director and composed of four professors, two from the Geneva Graduate Institute and two from the University of Geneva.  Administratively, the  CIDS Council  is the overarching body supervising both the CIDS and the MIDS. Half of its members are appointed by the University of Geneva, the other half by the Geneva Graduate Institute. The CIDS Council sets the strategy and oversees all matters regarding the functioning of the Center. </p>  <p> Parent Institutions  <br>   <br>MIDS Regulations</p>  <p> Learn more about our team and our community </p>
