        <p>"TheÂ MIDS was a wonderful experience, allowing me to immerse myself for a year in a stimulating environment where I was able to deepen my knowledge of international law and international trade law. ... I have also learned to look at problems from different angles."</p><p><b><i>Pietro Acerbi, MIDS'10</i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>"The MIDS was academically the most challenging thing I had done. I had to spend a lot of time reading and catching up with legal concepts that were unknown to me at that point. Nevertheless, it is still one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. I would absolutely do it all over again!"</p><p><b><i>Great Rios, MIDS'09</i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>"My time at the MIDS was both intense, delightful, fun, and eye-opening"</p><p><b><i>Sashia Diandra Anindita, MIDS'23</i></b></p>
