        <p>"The MIDS was academically the most challenging thing I had done. I had to spend a lot of time reading and catching up with legal concepts that were unknown to me at that point. Nevertheless, it is still one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. I would absolutely do it all over again!"</p><p><b><i>Great Rios, MIDS'09</i></b></p><p>"TheÂ MIDS was a wonderful experience, allowing me to immerse myself for a year in a stimulating environment where I was able to deepen my knowledge of international law and international trade law. ... I have also learned to look at problems from different angles."</p><p><b><i>Pietro Acerbi, MIDS'10</i></b></p><p>"The MIDS was an enriching and life/career-changing experience.... I was particularly pleased with the exposure to high-caliber arbitration practitioners and the multicultural environment of the program. The intra-MIDS moot court was perhaps my highlight of the program. Putting legal knowledge to test under a hearing-like environment was no easy task, but in my view it summed up the work of an arbitration practitioner and strengthened the ties among students as well."</p><p><b><i>Yuri Mantilla, MIDS'12</i></b></p><p>"The MIDS not only paved the way to my current job in international arbitration in Switzerland; it also gave me access to a huge network of international disputes lawyers, many of whom I now call friends. It was a career and life-changing experience."</p><p><b><i>Courtney Furner, MIDS'17</i></b></p><p>"My time at the MIDS was both intense, delightful, fun, and eye-opening"</p><p><b><i>Sashia Diandra Anindita, MIDS'23</i></b></p><p>"What I experienced [at the MIDS] was so much more than an academic program. I truly grew as an individual."</p><p><b><i>Sanskriti Sharma, MIDS'23</i></b></p>
