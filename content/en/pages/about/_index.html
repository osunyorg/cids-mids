        <p>An accredited, top-tier LL.M. program based in Geneva, Switzerland, the MIDS stands for "Master in International Dispute Settlement."</p><p>Offered jointly by the <b>University of Geneva Faculty of Law</b> and the <b>Geneva Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies</b>, it delivers advanced and specialized legal training in international dispute settlement.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>An LL.M. (short for the latin "<i>Legum Magister"</i>) is a Master of Laws degree that typically follows a first law degree, such as a J.D. (Juris Doctor) or an LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws). LL.M. degrees allow lawyers to specialize in specific areas of law and are often key stepping stones to access competitive areas of practice, access to job opportunities in new markets, for career advancement, or to become eligible to practice in other jurisdictions.</p>
