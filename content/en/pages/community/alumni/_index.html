            Mentor new MIDS students

          description: >-
            You can give back and reconnect with the MIDS by volunteering to mentor new MIDS students. This is a very flexible and low-key way for you to stay involved and connect with your successors at the MIDS.

            Help us recruit future MIDS students

          description: >-
            Because we believe that nobody is in a better position to know what students need to succeed in the MIDS than former students themselves, we seek the input of alumni in our admissions process. If you are interested, please email us at info@mids.ch.
