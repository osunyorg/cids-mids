        <p>The MIDS program and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) established an Assistant Legal Counsel Fellowship program in 2016. By virtue of this agreement, each year, one MIDS graduate is selected to join the International Bureau of the PCA for a 12-month fellowship, based on their academic performance in the MIDS program. The fellowship is financially supported by the MIDS. </p>

      notes: >-
        <p>The Permanent Court of Arbitration</p><p>The PCA is an intergovernmental organization with 117 member states. Established in 1899 to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution between States, the PCA has developed into a modern, multifaceted institution meeting the dispute resolution needs of the international community.</p><p>The PCA's Secretariat - the International Bureau - consists of an experienced team of legal and administrative staff of various nationalities. It is headed by its Secretary-General. The bureau provides administrative support to tribunals and commissions, serving as the official channel of communications and ensuring safe custody of documents. The International Bureau provides services such as financial administration, logistical and technical support for meetings and hearings, travel arrangements, and general secretarial and linguistic support. It also provides administrative support to tribunals or commissions conducting PCA dispute settlement proceedings outside The Netherlands.</p>

        <p>The MIDS program offers a unique opportunity for students to pursue a double degree with the National University of Singapore (NUS). Established in 2017, the Double Degree Program (DDP) enables students to earn both the LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) and the NUS LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (IADR). Students who complete the curriculum at either MIDS or NUS with an IADR specialization can enroll in the other institution for an additional (third) consecutive semester. Upon successfully finishing their studies in both locations, students graduate with both the MIDS and NUS LL.M. degrees.</p><p>The Double Degree Program (DDP) leverages the strengths of two leading academic institutions in international dispute settlement. This program provides MIDS students with a valuable opportunity to enhance their qualifications and expand their professional networks in two major cities for international arbitration and dispute resolution. By studying at both institutions, students benefit from the rich educational resources and diverse cultural perspectives each university offers.</p>
