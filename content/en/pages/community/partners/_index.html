        <p>The MIDS and the National University of Singapore (NUS) agreed on establishing a Double Degree Program (DDP) starting in the academic year 2017-2018. The DDP offers students of each institution who have completed the curriculum for either the MIDS or the NUS LLM with specialization in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution to enrol in the other institution for an additional (third) semester. Upon successful completion of this additional semester and some extra credits students receive both NUS LLM and MIDS LLM degrees.</p><p>The DDP is designed to take full advantage of two leading academic institutions in the field of international dispute settlement. The program allows participants to study and build a network in one of the institutions and then later explore the regional and subject specificities and network opportunities in the other university and venue.</p><p>More information on the <a href="/en/academics/curriculum/mids-nus-double-degree/" target="_blank">dedicated page<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>.</p>
