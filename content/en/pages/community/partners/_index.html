By virtue of this agreement, each year, one MIDS graduate is selected to join the International Bureau of the PCA for a 12-month fellowship, based on their academic performance in the MIDS program. The fellowship is financially supported by the MIDS.  <br>The Permanent Court of Arbitration The PCA is an intergovernmental organization with 117 member states. Established in 1899 to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution between States, the PCA has developed into a modern, multifaceted institution meeting the dispute resolution needs of the international community. The PCA's Secretariat - the International Bureau - consists of an experienced team of legal and administrative staff of various nationalities. It is headed by its Secretary-General. The bureau provides administrative support to tribunals and commissions, serving as the official channel of communications and ensuring safe custody of documents. The International Bureau provides services such as financial administration, logistical and technical support for meetings and hearings, travel arrangements, and general secretarial and linguistic support. It also provides administrative support to tribunals or commissions conducting PCA dispute settlement proceedings outside The Netherlands.</p>  <p> Law Firms  <br> Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler  <br>Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler  has been a significant partner of the MIDS since the program's inception in 2008. With close ties not only to the firm, but also to some of its individual members, this partnership promotes many academic activities and opportunities. Senior members of the firm, including Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Prof. Sébastien Besson and Dr. Michele Potestà teach courses at the MIDS. Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler sponsors a generous scholarship covering MIDS tuition fees and partial living expenses in Geneva, and also offers internships to MIDS students each year.</p>  <p> LALIVE  <br>LALIVE  has shared a long-standing and impactful relationship with the MIDS, nearly since the program’s founding. Each year, LALIVE supports the MIDS program through various opportunities.  The firm collaborates with MIDS to deliver a practical training seminar for MIDS students on international arbitration, with a particular focus on commercial arbitration.  LALIVE sponsors a generous scholarship covering MIDS tuition fees and partial living expenses in Geneva, and also offers internships to MIDS students each year.</p>  <p> Three Crowns LLP  <br>Three Crowns LLP  partners with the MIDS to support one student each year through a generous scholarship. Established in 2021 by Three Crowns LLP, the Jan Paulsson Scholarship provides support for one MIDS student from a developing economy who demonstrates financial need. Covering full tuition and partial living expenses, the scholarship honors the extraordinary legacy of Jan Paulsson—one of Three Crowns’ founding partners—and his steadfast commitment to mentoring and training junior practitioners.</p>  <p> Schellenberg Wittmer  <br>The MIDS has an official partnership with the  Schellenberg Wittmer  law firm since February 2022. As part of their partnership with the MIDS, Schellenberg Wittmer organizes a seminar on the practical aspects of working with experts and witnesses in international arbitration.

Established in 2017, the Double Degree Program (DDP) enables students to earn both the LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) and the NUS LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (IADR). Students who complete the curriculum at either MIDS or NUS with an IADR specialization can enroll in the other institution for an additional (third) consecutive semester. Upon successfully finishing their studies in both locations, students graduate with both the MIDS and NUS LL.M. degrees. The Double Degree Program (DDP) leverages the strengths of two leading academic institutions in international dispute settlement. This program provides MIDS students with a valuable opportunity to enhance their qualifications and expand their professional networks in two major cities for international arbitration and dispute resolution. By studying at both institutions, students benefit from the rich educational resources and diverse cultural perspectives each university offers.</p>  <p> Summer Schools  <br> Paris Arbitration Academy  <br>Since its inception in 2011, the International Academy for Arbitration Law in Paris has been supported by the MIDS. In recent years, the MIDS has sponsored a cocktail event for students attending the Paris Arbitration Academy, featuring a program presentation by MIDS staff and organized in collaboration with the ICC. The Arbitration Academy offers advanced summer courses in Paris for students and young practitioners interested in international arbitration. Designed by leading academics and practitioners, the program covers essential aspects of international arbitration, with courses taught by renowned experts in international commercial and investment arbitration. MIDS faculty members, including Professors Zachary Douglas, Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, and Makane Moïse Mbengue, have contributed to the Academy by delivering General and Special Courses. Many successful MIDS applicants have attended the Arbitration Academy before their admission, as completing this program provides a solid foundation for the comprehensive training offered by the MIDS. We highly encourage anyone interested in international arbitration, particularly those preparing for the MIDS, to enroll in the Paris Arbitration Academy.</p>  <p> ELSA Arbitration Summer School  <br>The European Law Students Association (ELSA) in Switzerland established a biennial Arbitration Summer School starting in 2013. In recognizing the importance of arbitration in international business and the role which Switzerland and Geneva play, ELSA runs this one-week intense academic, social and networking arbitration program in Geneva. The ELSA Arbitration Summer School is part of the outstanding summer schools program which ELSA conducts in many different areas of law throughout Europe. MIDS has contributed to the Arbitration Summer School by sharing our teaching facilities in Geneva, and by having MIDS professors join the summer school faculty. MIDS supports the ELSA Arbitration Summer School as an excellent opportunity for young law students to become familiar with international arbitration at the heart of one of its international practice hubs and at one of its leading academic institutions.</p>  <p> Interested in partnering with us?  <br>You represent an institution or firm interested in partnering with the MIDS?

        <p>The MIDS program offers a unique opportunity for students to pursue a double degree with the National University of Singapore (NUS). Established in 2017, the Double Degree Program (DDP) enables students to earn both the LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) and the NUS LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (IADR). Students who complete the curriculum at either MIDS or NUS with an IADR specialization can enroll in the other institution for an additional (third) consecutive semester. Upon successfully finishing their studies in both locations, students graduate with both the MIDS and NUS LL.M. degrees.</p><p>The Double Degree Program (DDP) leverages the strengths of two leading academic institutions in international dispute settlement. This program provides MIDS students with a valuable opportunity to enhance their qualifications and expand their professional networks in two major cities for international arbitration and dispute resolution. By studying at both institutions, students benefit from the rich educational resources and diverse cultural perspectives each university offers.</p>
