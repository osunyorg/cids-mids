        <p>The MIDS and LALIVE have a long-standing partnership, dating back to almost the beginning of the MIDS program. This partnership includes the following key elements:</p><ol> <li>A <a href="https://www.cids.ch/mids/the-program/curriculum/seminars/page?page_id=48&amp;display_title=0">practical training</a> seminar on international arbitration, with a particular focus on commercial arbitration. Through this half-day seminar, LALIVE’s lawyers, including partners and counsel, provide the students with not only practical training, but also their views and advice, based on their first-hand experience.</li> <li>A commitment on the part of LALIVE to engage as interns around 5 MIDS students each year. This internship is an integral part of the MIDS curriculum and a key milestone for the selected candidates, who are thus offered the opportunity to enhance their practical skills in one of the leading firms in the field of international arbitration.</li> <li>A full scholarship, covering both the MIDS tuition fees and living expenses in Geneva for one student, for the duration of the one-year program. For more information on this, please go <a href="https://www.cids.ch/mids/admissions/scholarships/page?page_id=53&amp;display_title=0">here</a>.</li> </ol><p>Speaking at the 2019-20 MIDS graduation ceremony, LALIVE partner <a href="https://www.lalive.law/people/baizeau-domitille/" target="_blank">Domitille Baizeau<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> highlighted, “LALIVE has had strong links with the Graduate Institute for many years, going back to the chair of late Professor Pierre Lalive, in more recent years through the joint organisation of the yearly LALIVE lecture and through our internship programme, almost since the commencement of the MIDS (…) this has happened because the Graduate Institute has always been an academic institution, and the MIDS a course of outstanding international reputation”.</p>

        <p>The MIDS and the National University of Singapore (NUS) agreed on establishing a Double Degree Program (DDP) starting in the academic year 2017-2018. The DDP offers students of each institution who have completed the curriculum for either the MIDS or the NUS LLM with specialization in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution to enrol in the other institution for an additional (third) semester. Upon successful completion of this additional semester and some extra credits students receive both NUS LLM and MIDS LLM degrees.</p><p>The DDP is designed to take full advantage of two leading academic institutions in the field of international dispute settlement. The program allows participants to study and build a network in one of the institutions and then later explore the regional and subject specificities and network opportunities in the other university and venue.</p><p>More information on the <a href="/en/academics/curriculum/mids-nus-double-degree/" target="_blank">dedicated page<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>.</p>
