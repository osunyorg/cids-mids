        <p>The MIDS offers a limited number of scholarships each year; the number of scholarships and amount awarded vary from year to year.</p><p>Coverage ranges from full tuition to partial tuition support, with some scholarships also including partial living expense support.</p><p>MIDS-managed scholarships are awarded after a careful assessment of each application, considering both financial need and academic merit. Priority is given to outstanding students who would not otherwise be able to undertake the program.</p><p>The MIDS scholarship program is possible thanks to the generous support of its donors, among others:</p><ul> <li> <b><a href="https://lk-k.com/" target="_blank">Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler Scholarship<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b>: Covers full tuition and partial living expenses</li> <li> <b><a href="https://www.lalive.law/fr/" target="_blank">LALIVE Scholarship<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b>: Covers full tuition and partial living expenses</li> <li> <b>Jan Paulsson Scholarship (supported by <a href="https://www.threecrownsllp.com/" target="_blank">Three Crowns LLP<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>)</b>: Covers full tuition and partial living expenses</li> <li> <b><a href="https://www.youngicca.org/" target="_blank">MIDS-Young ICCA Scholarship<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b>: Covers full tuition</li> <li> <b><a href="https://www.lambadarioslaw.gr/" target="_blank">Epaminondas Lambadarios Scholarship<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b>: Provides partial tuition support</li> <li> <b>George Fessas Family Scholarship</b>: Provides partial tuition support</li> <li> <b>MIDS Alumni Association Scholarship</b>: Provides partial tuition support</li> </ul>

        <p>The MIDS scholarship program also benefits from the generous support of an anonymous donor who provides multiple partial scholarships. These awards further expand the number of partial scholarships available to admitted students in need of financial support.</p>
