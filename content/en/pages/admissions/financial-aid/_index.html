        <p>The MIDS offers a limited number of scholarships each year in the form of full and partial scholarships. Their number and amount may vary from one year to another.</p><p>MIDS scholarships are awarded after a carefull assessment of the needs and merits of each individual file. Priority is given to outstanding students who would not be able to undertake the program without financial assistance.</p><p>Only students undertaking the MIDS program in one year are eligible for MIDS scholarships. Since they incur more expenses, MIDS students coming to Geneva for the entirety of the program are given priority in the scholarship attribution process.</p>
