        <p>According to international rankings, Geneva figures among the cities with the highest quality of life... and among the most expensive ones. For students, this has a direct impact on living expenses which must be taken into account when planning your budget for the year. MIDS estimates that a minimum of CHF 1'500 - 2'000 per month is needed to cover living expenses during the program.  </p>
