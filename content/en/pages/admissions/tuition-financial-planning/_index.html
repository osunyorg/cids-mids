    Tuition & Financial Planning
  summary: >-
    <p>Joining the MIDS is a valuable investment in your future, but it is also a significant commitment that requires careful consideration and planning.   </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Tuition Fees  <br>   <br>Tuition fees for the 2025-2026 MIDS program are set at  CHF 28’000 . As per  MIDS regulations,  tuition fees are due and non-refundable once the academic year has started.</p>  <p> Enrollment Deposit  <br>   <br>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification; the exact deadline is specified in the admission letter. This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees. </p>  <p>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to waitlisted candidates in April. Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current admissions cycle. If a candidate wishes to defer or withdraw from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer. All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>  <p> Schedule of Tuition Payments  <br>   <br>The remaining tuition fees are payable in three installments according to the following schedule:  <br> CHF 3'300 by 15 May 2025  <br> CHF 12'000 by 15 July 2025  <br> CHF 12'000 by 1 October 2025 </p>  <p>Candidates awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship that partially covers tuition fees will receive an alternative payment schedule detailed in their scholarship award letter. Candidates may request an alternative tuition installment schedule based on individual circumstances, such as a preference to pay the full tuition in a single transfer to lessen bank fees. Requests for an alternative schedule will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p> Student Status Extension  <br>   <br>Enrolled students may also have the option to extend their student status at the MIDS for one additional year beyond the initial academic period (until September 2027) in order to complete an internship within the scope of the curriculum.  An administrative fee of CHF 500 will apply to any extension of student status. <br>Detailed information on internship opportunities, extension of student status, etc. will be provided to enrolled students after the program begins.</p>  <p> Financial planning  <br>   <br>Careful financial planning is essential for prospective MIDS students. Applicants should explore all funding options well before enrollment to ensure they can cover tuition and living expenses.  Early research and preparation is strongly advised, even before receiving admission results from MIDS. Some external scholarships, loans, and other forms of financial assistance may have early deadlines or require time-consuming processes. Possible sources of funding include:  <br>  <br> Personal funds:  Savings, or support from family, relatives, or friends  <br>  <br> Private foundations and organizations:  Grant foundations, NGOs, or private institutions in the applicant’s home country  <br>  <br> Government resources:  Scholarships, grants, or financial assistance offered by government agencies in the applicant’s home country  <br>  <br> Employer support:  Sponsorship, loans, salary advances, or leave of absence for study purposes  <br>  <br> Loans:  Banks or specialized student loan providers  <br>  <br> Current or recent academic institutions  for scholarships  <br>  <br> Crowdfunding  and other creative funding combinations </p>  <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the student services office at their current or recent academic institution for information on available scholarships and financial resources. Additionally, contacting the education department of their home country’s government may provide guidance on funding options offered through government programs. Useful resources for financial aid research:  <br> https://www.internationalscholarships.com/ https://www.mastersportal.com/scholarships/    <br> </p>  <p> Cost of Living in Geneva  <br>   <br>Geneva is consistently ranked among cities with a high quality of life—and a correspondingly high cost of living. Applicants should consider their budget in advance.  For an example of a  detailed monthly budget estimate, consult the Geneva Graduate Institute's website  (last updated February 2023). <br>Swiss authorities require proof of financial means to grant a student visa, though no fixed amount is mandated. Generally, a balance of CHF 20,000–25,000 or a regular income of CHF 2,500 per month is recommended (approximately CHF 1,000 for personal expenses, plus rent and health insurance costs). This requirement can be fulfilled through a combination of personal funds, financial aid, loans, or a guarantor. More information on providing proof of financial means will be sent to admitted candidates.</p>  <p> Return on Investment: The MIDS Advantage  <br>   <br>While living and studying in Geneva requires a significant financial commitment, the MIDS program is designed to offer exceptional value. Tuition fees are kept competitive with comparable programs, and our partnerships allow us to offer scholarships that make the program accessible to students from a diverse range of backgrounds. For students financing their studies independently, the MIDS program represents a meaningful investment of both time and resources, offering an immersive learning experience that extends well beyond the classroom. Through the expansion of their professional network and the opportunity to join a dynamic community of MIDS alumni and associated partners, all students gain a foundation for long-term career growth.  The MIDS equips graduates to effectively pursue and excel in the field, making their time in Geneva a valuable investment in their future and a significant step toward career success.</p>  <p>  "The MIDS was an extremely valuable addition to my CV. It's a degree that carries a lot of weight with law firms and practitioners."  <br>Vamika Puri, MIDS'21 <br>Associate, Three Crowns</p>  <p> Learn about MIDS-managed scholarships </p>
