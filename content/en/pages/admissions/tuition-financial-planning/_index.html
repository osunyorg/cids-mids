        <p>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification; the exact deadline is specified in the admission letter.</p><p>This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees.</p><ul> </ul>

      notes: >-
        <p>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to waitlisted candidates in April.</p><p>Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current admissions cycle. If a candidate wishes to defer or withdraw from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer.</p><p>All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>

        <p>Careful financial planning is essential for prospective MIDS students. Applicants should explore all funding options well before enrollment to ensure they can cover tuition and living expenses. </p><p>Early research and preparation is strongly advised, even before receiving admission results from MIDS. Some external scholarships, loans, and other forms of financial assistance may have early deadlines or require time-consuming processes.</p><p>Possible sources of funding include:</p><ul> <li> <b>Personal funds:</b> Savings, or support from family, relatives, or friends</li> <li> <b>Private foundations and organizations: </b>Grant foundations, NGOs, or private institutions in the applicant’s home country</li> <li> <b>Government resources:</b> Scholarships, grants, or financial assistance offered by government agencies in the applicant’s home country</li> <li> <b>Employer support:</b> Sponsorship, loans, salary advances, or leave of absence for study purposes</li> <li> <b>Loans:</b> Banks or specialized student loan providers</li> <li> <b>Current or recent academic institutions </b>for scholarships</li> <li> <b>Crowdfunding </b>and other creative funding combinations</li> </ul>

      notes: >-
        <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the student services office at their current or recent academic institution for information on available scholarships and financial resources. Additionally, contacting the education department of their home country’s government may provide guidance on funding options offered through government programs.</p><p>Useful resources for financial aid research:</p><ul> </ul><p><a href="https://www.internationalscholarships.com/" target="_blank">https://www.internationalscholarships.com/<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></p><p><a href="https://www.mastersportal.com/scholarships/" target="_blank">https://www.mastersportal.com/scholarships/<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> </p><ul> </ul><ul> </ul>

        <p>Geneva is consistently ranked among cities with a high quality of life—and a correspondingly high cost of living. Applicants should consider their budget in advance. </p><p>For an example of a <a href="https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/sites/internet/files/2023-02/Monthly%20budget%20estimate%20for%20students%20in%20Geneva_0.pdf" target="_blank">detailed monthly budget estimate, consult the Geneva Graduate Institute's website<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> (last updated February 2023).</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Swiss authorities require proof of financial means to grant a student visa, though no fixed amount is mandated. Generally, a balance of CHF 20,000–25,000 or a regular income of CHF 2,500 per month is recommended (approximately CHF 1,000 for personal expenses, plus rent and health insurance costs). This requirement can be fulfilled through a combination of personal funds, financial aid, loans, or a guarantor. More information on providing proof of financial means will be sent to admitted candidates.</p>
