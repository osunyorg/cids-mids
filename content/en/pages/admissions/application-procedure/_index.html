        <p>Admissions to the MIDS program are based on a comprehensive evaluation of each application. While no minimum GPA is required, the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted.</p><p>The MIDS Admissions Committee thoroughly reviews all complete applications, placing particular emphasis on academic performance, the motivation letter, and relevant professional experience. Priority is given to applicants who demonstrate both strong academic achievement and a clear, compelling motivation for joining the program.</p>
