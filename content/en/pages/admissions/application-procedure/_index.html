        <p>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification. This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to waitlisted candidates in April.</p><p>Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current admissions cycle. If a candidate wishes to defer or withdraw from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer.</p><p>All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>
