Without confirmation, admission may not be offered if a place becomes available. Candidates admitted from the waiting list cannot apply for MIDS-managed scholarships. Candidates admitted from the waiting list have one week from the notification date to accept the admission offer and pay the deposit to confirm enrollment.</p>  <p> Enrollment Deposit  <br>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification. This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees. <br>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to round 2 candidates in March and waitlisted candidates in April.  Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current admissions cycle. If a candidate wishes to defer or withdraw from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer. All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>  <p> Deferral Policy  <br>The MIDS does not permit deferrals. Candidates who choose not to enroll for the 2025-2026 academic year and wish to join in the future must reapply in the following admissions cycle. Previous admission to the program does not guarantee admission in a later cycle; each admission cycle is assessed independently.</p>  <p> Confidentiality  <br>All information provided in the application and supporting documents will be treated with the strictest confidentiality and will only be reviewed by the MIDS Admissions Committee (including the MIDS Committee and MIDS Staff), MIDS-managed scholarship donors (in the case of a scholarship application), and the MIDS parent institutions, the Geneva Graduate Institute and the University of Geneva. </p>  <p>   <br>Start your application now.</p>  <p>Application Portal <br>https://inscription.unige.ch/en-US/signin?ReturnUrl=%2Fen-US%2Fapply-to-edition%2F%3Fid%3DMIDS26</p>  <p> Questions?

        <p>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification. This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to round 2 candidates in March and waitlisted candidates in April. </p><p>Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current admissions cycle. If a candidate wishes to defer or withdraw from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer.</p><p>All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>
