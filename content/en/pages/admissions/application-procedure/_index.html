        <p>Admissions to the MIDS program are based on a comprehensive evaluation of each application. While no minimum GPA is required, the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted.</p><p>The MIDS Admissions Committee thoroughly reviews all complete applications, placing particular emphasis on academic performance, the motivation letter, and relevant professional experience. Priority is given to applicants who demonstrate both strong academic achievement and a clear, compelling motivation for joining the program.</p><p>Applications for the MIDS 2025-2026 program will be open from Thursday, 31 October 2024 at 12:00 noon CET to Sunday, 15 December 2024 at 23:59 CET.</p>
