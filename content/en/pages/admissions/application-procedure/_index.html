        <p>The non-refundable application fee of CHF 100 (net of bank charges), must be paid in full by Friday, 20 December 2024 at 23:59 CET or the application will not be reviewed.</p><p>Instructions on how to make the payment will be provided after submission of the application.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Payment of the application fee does not mean that an application has been submitted, and it does not guarantee review if it is missing required components. It is the applicant’s responsibility to make sure that their complete application is submitted through the portal on time.</p><p>The application fee is non-refundable, even in the case of an erroneous, incomplete (and therefore, not reviewed), withdrawn, or rejected application. It cannot be carried over to a future application cycle, and it will not be credited towards the tuition fees in the case of admission to the program.</p>

        <p>Admitted candidates must secure their place in the program by submitting a non-refundable deposit of CHF 700 shortly after receiving their admission notification. This deposit will be credited toward the total tuition fees.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Admitted candidates who accept an offer but do not pay the CHF 700 deposit will not be considered officially enrolled and may forfeit their place once the MIDS begins extending offers to waitlisted candidates in April.</p><p>Please note that the non-refundable deposit is valid only for the current application cycle. If a candidate withdraws from the program, the deposit cannot be transferred to a future cycle and will not be credited toward tuition fees in the event of another future admission offer.</p><p>All admitted candidates must pay the CHF 700 deposit regardless of whether they receive a scholarship, except those awarded a MIDS-managed scholarship covering the full tuition fees.</p>

Candidates who choose not to enroll for the 2025-2026 academic year and wish to join in the future must reapply in the following admissions cycle. Previous admission to the program does not guarantee admission in a later cycle; each admission cycle is assessed independently.</p>
