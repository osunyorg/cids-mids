        <p>To be considered for the program, applicants must have received, or expect to receive by the end of December 2024, a first complete law degree (such as a Bologna Master’s degree, a J.D. or an LL.B.) or another academic qualification deemed equivalent by the MIDS Admissions Committee.</p><p>There is no minimum grade point average requirement, but the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted. The Admissions Committee conducts a thorough review of each candidate’s complete academic record, and demonstrated interest in dispute settlement through past course choices may be positively considered.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Applicants from other academic areas holding a Master’s degree or its recognized equivalent may be considered on a case-by-case basis. These applicants must submit an explanation for their interest to undertake the MIDS and provide assurances as to their legal background in order to successfully complete the MIDS.</p>
