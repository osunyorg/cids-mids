    Application Requirements
  summary: >-
    <p>The MIDS is a highly selective and competitive program. Applicants must meet a number of key requirements to be considered for admission.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Admissions to the MIDS program are based on a comprehensive evaluation of each application. While no minimum GPA is required, the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted. The MIDS Admissions Committee thoroughly reviews all complete applications, placing particular emphasis on academic performance, the motivation letter, and relevant professional experience. Priority is given to applicants who demonstrate both strong academic achievement and a clear, compelling motivation for joining the program. Applications for the MIDS 2025-2026 program will be open from Thursday, 31 October 2024 to  Sunday, 15 December 2024 at 23:59 CET. Please read all the following information carefully before starting an application, as it will help ensure a quick and smooth application process. There is no application fee for the 2025-2026 admissions cycle.</p>  <p> Academic Requirements  <br>   <br>To be considered for the program, applicants must have received, or expect to receive by the end of December 2024, a first complete law degree (such as a Bologna Master’s degree, a J.D. or an LL.B.) or another academic qualification deemed equivalent by the MIDS Admissions Committee. There is no minimum grade point average requirement, but the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted. The Admissions Committee conducts a thorough review of each candidate’s complete academic record, and demonstrated interest in dispute settlement through past course choices may be positively considered. <br>Applicants from other academic areas holding a Master’s degree or its recognized equivalent may be considered on a case-by-case basis. These applicants must submit an explanation for their interest to undertake the MIDS and provide assurances as to their legal background in order to successfully complete the MIDS.</p>  <p> Language Requirements   <br>   <br>All applicants must demonstrate an excellent command of English. Applicants whose primary language is not English and who have not completed full-time secondary or post-secondary education in English within the last five years must provide standardized test results demonstrating English proficiency.</p>  <p> Accepted English Language Proficiency Tests </p>  <p>Only the tests and certificates listed below are accepted by the MIDS. The test date must be within two years of the current application cycle (e.g., for the 2025-2026 cycle, the test must have been taken no earlier than October 2022).</p>  <p>   <br>Test results submitted in a protected PDF format may be difficult for the MIDS Admissions Committee to access through the portal. Applicants using a protected PDF should also email the document to info@mids.ch. Applicants may request a waiver of the test requirement if they meet one of the following conditions:  <br> They have completed at least one year of full-time study at the university level exclusively in English within the last five years, or  <br> They have at least two years of professional experience where English was the primary working language, within the last five years.  <br> The waiver request must be sent by email to info@mids.ch by the application deadline (Sunday, 15 December 2024 at 23:59 CET). The email should be addressed to the MIDS Admissions Committee, and must include a short statement from the applicant explaining how they meet one of the two exceptional conditions above, as well as supporting documentation. If requesting a waiver based on professional experience, please include a statement from a supervisor or HR confirming full-time work in English. <br>The MIDS Admissions Committee will review the request and may schedule an interview to assess English proficiency further. If a waiver request is denied, applicants will be notified with sufficient time to take an English proficiency test in order for their application to be considered.</p>  <p> Learn more </p>
