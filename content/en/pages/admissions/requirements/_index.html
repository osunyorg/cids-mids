    Application Requirements
  summary: >-
    <p>The MIDS is a highly selective and competitive program. Applicants must meet a number of key requirements to be considered for admission.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Admissions to the MIDS program are based on a comprehensive evaluation of each application. While no minimum GPA is required, the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted. The MIDS Admissions Committee thoroughly reviews all complete applications, placing particular emphasis on academic performance, the motivation letter, and relevant professional experience. Priority is given to applicants who demonstrate both strong academic achievement and a clear, compelling motivation for joining the program. Applications for the MIDS 2026-2027 program are now open. Please read all the following information carefully before starting an application, as it will help ensure a quick and smooth application process. There is no application fee for the 2026-2027 admissions cycle.</p>  <p> Academic Requirements  <br>   <br>To be considered for the program, applicants must have received, or expect to receive  by the end of December 2025 , a first complete law degree (such as a Bologna Master’s degree, a J.D. or an LL.B.) or another academic qualification deemed equivalent by the MIDS Admissions Committee. There is no minimum grade point average requirement, but the admissions process is highly competitive, with fewer than 20% of applicants admitted. The Admissions Committee conducts a thorough review of each candidate’s complete academic record, and demonstrated interest in dispute settlement through past course choices may be positively considered.  <br>Applicants from other academic areas holding a Master's degree or its  <br>recognized equivalent may be considered on a case-by-case basis. These  <br>applicants must submit an explanation for their interest to undertake  <br>the MIDS and provide assurances as to their legal background in order to <br> successfully complete the MIDS.   <br>Recommendation letters must be uploaded directly by  <br>applicants through the online application portal, together with the rest <br> of their application documents.</p>  <p> Language Requirements   <br>   <br>All applicants must demonstrate an excellent command of English. Applicants whose primary language is not English and who have not completed full-time secondary or post-secondary education in English within the last five years must provide standardized test results demonstrating English proficiency.</p>  <p> Accepted English Language Proficiency Tests </p>  <p>Only the tests and certificates listed below are accepted by the MIDS. The test date must be within two years of the current application cycle (e.g., for the 2026-2027 cycle, the test must have been taken no earlier than October 2023).</p>  <p>   <br>Test results submitted in a protected PDF format may be difficult for the MIDS Admissions Committee to access through the portal. Applicants using a protected PDF should also email the document to info@mids.ch. Applicants may request a waiver of the test requirement if they meet one of the following conditions:  <br> They have completed at least one year of full-time study at the university level exclusively in English within the last five years, or  <br> They have at least two years of professional experience where English was the primary working language, within the last five years.  <br>  <br>The waiver request and supporting documentation must be uploaded directly to the online application portal under the section "Documents." The request must include a short statement from the applicant explaining how they meet one of the two exceptional conditions above, along with relevant supporting documents. Applicants requesting a waiver based on university studies should include official confirmation that the courses were conducted in English. Those requesting a waiver based on professional experience should provide a statement from a supervisor or HR confirming full-time work in English.</p>  <p>  <br>The MIDS Admissions Committee will review the request and may schedule  <br>an interview to assess English proficiency further. If a waiver request  <br>is denied, applicants will be notified with sufficient time to take an  <br>English proficiency test in order for their application to be  <br>considered.</p>  <p> Application Materials  <br>  To apply, applicants must submit an online application with the following documents by the deadline (date to be confirmed). Incomplete applications will not be considered. <br>1. Curriculum Vitae <br>Up-to-date CV in English.</p>  <p>2. Motivation Letter <br>An essay in English (up to 1000 words) addressing the following points: Interest in Dispute Settlement : A description of the applicant’s interest in dispute settlement, focusing on key motivations without excessively repeating details from the CV. Specific Interest in the MIDS Program : An explanation of how the MIDS program’s unique offerings align with the applicant’s interests and goals. Contribution to the MIDS Community : A reflection on the applicant’s anticipated contribution to the academic and collaborative environment at MIDS, drawing on relevant skills, perspectives, or experiences. Impact of the MIDS Program : An outline of how completing the MIDS program is expected to impact the applicant’s life, community, or professional landscape. Further Study Consideration  (if applicable): For applicants with an additional post-graduate degree (completed or in progress), a clarification of why the MIDS program is essential for career advancement. Where relevant, applicants should use specific examples to illustrate their interests, experiences, and professional ambitions.</p>  <p>3. Letters of Recommendation <br>Two recommendation letters from academic or professional sources. Each letter must be:  <br> On official letterhead,  <br> Dated within six months of the application date,  <br> Signed, and accompanied by a certified translation if not in English or French.  <br>  <br>Applicants should upload a <br> copy of the recommendation letters on the application portal, unless  <br>the recommender prefers to send the letter only to the MIDS and not to  <br>the applicant. In addition, please provide the contact information of the references for  <br>whom you will submit a letter of recommendation, as the MIDS may proceed  <br>with reference checks.</p>  <p>4. Academic Records <br>Copies of degrees and diplomas for all university studies completed thus far; Transcripts showing all university examinations and grades for all university studies completed thus far; If currently enrolled in a university program, an attestation of current enrollment from the university with an official record of all university examinations and grades obtained to date. Academic records must be accompanied by certified translations if not in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.  Non-certified copies of academic records are acceptable for uploading to the portal for the application phase. Admitted and waitlisted applicants will be required to promptly submit official, certified copies of their academic records upon receiving their admissions decision.</p>  <p>5. Language Proficiency <br>Official language scores, if applicable, or a copy of the waiver request must be uploaded directly to the online application portal under the section 'Documents.'</p>  <p>6. Passport <br>A color photocopy of the applicant’s passport or, if the applicant is not in possession of a passport, another official government-issued identification document.</p>  <p>7. Writing Sample (optional) <br>A 10-page excerpt (with table of contents) from a major paper written during university studies, in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.</p>  <p>Important notice <br>Do not send original documents by mail; all submitted materials become the property of the program and cannot be returned. In the course of completing the online application, applicants will be asked if they intend to apply for a MIDS and/or MIDS-Young ICCA scholarship. This question is simply to gauge interest, and the response is not a factor in deciding admission. Further information on applying for these MIDS-managed scholarships will be provided in due course to all applicants who have submitted complete applications. There are some items that applicants may wish to highlight or elaborate on in their applications, in addition to their academic and professional experiences. Please note that these items are considered possible assets, not requirements.  <br> Moot court experience;  <br> Summer schools;  <br> Internships in law firms, international organizations, international courts, arbitral institutions, and companies;  <br> Working languages other than English.  </p>  <p> Learn more </p>
