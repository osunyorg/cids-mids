        <p>Admissions to the MIDS program are decided on the basis of the quality of the overall application file. Priority is given to academic achievement and motivation. There are no minimum requirements for grade point average but the admission process is highly competitive as only less than 20% of the applicants are admitted. </p><p>All complete applications will be assessed by the MIDS Committee. Its members will evaluate, in particular, the academic performance, letters of recommendation and motivation letter. The MIDS Committee's decision is final. </p>
