        <p>Being a good lawyer requires more than knowledge, skills and experience: it requires being a well-rounded, open-minded, and collaborative individual. As such, for all the rigor, demands, and healthy dose of competition involved at the MIDS, it is also meant to be a collaborative journey. Through group projects, discussions, and networking opportunities, students develop essential teamwork skills, crucial for their future careers, and build lasting connections.</p>
