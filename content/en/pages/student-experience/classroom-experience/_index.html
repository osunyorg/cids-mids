        <p>Because of the diversity of subjects and the variety in the background and approach of our faculty, the curriculum employs a mix of lectures, seminars, case studies, and practical exercises, ensuring that students are exposed to a broad range of teaching methods that cater to different learning styles. During their time at the MIDS, all students will therefore be exposed to both familiar and novel methodologies.<br></p>

        <p>Recent graduates often describe the MIDS as a marathon: an intense and sometimes challenging year-long experience, but ultimately an extremely rewarding one. While we do our utmost to make our students' time in Geneva as pleasant and smooth as possible, the program is designed to be immersive, rigorous and demanding, and we encourage prospective students to not underestimate the level of personal commitment it requires.Â However, with the constant support of our faculty, lecturers, and our experienced and attentive administrative team, this allows students to become the best version of themselves while preparing them for the challenges of international dispute resolution and legal careers.</p><p>Furthermore, in the face of the challenges and adversity that are unavoidable in a demanding academic program, our graduates always highlight the extraordinary strength and fulfilling nature of the lifelong bonds they form with each other while at the MIDS.<br></p>
