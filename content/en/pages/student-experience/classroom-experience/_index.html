        <p>Because of the diversity of subjects and the variety in the background and approach of our faculty, the curriculum employs a mix of lectures, seminars, case studies, and practical exercises, ensuring that students are exposed to a broad range of teaching methods that cater to different learning styles. During their time at the MIDS, all students will therefore be exposed to both familiar and novel methodologies.<br></p>
