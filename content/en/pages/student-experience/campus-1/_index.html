    <p>  <br>The MIDS is headquartered in Villa Moynier, a historic villa on the shores of Lake Geneva with a view to the Mont Blanc. As a joint program of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva Graduate Institute (IHEID), MIDS activities take place at both institutions, in the Plainpalais area--Geneva's student district near the Old Town--for UNIGE, and at the House of Peace--Maison de la Paix in French--in the International Organizations district for the Graduate Institute.The joint nature of the program also means that MIDS students can take full advantage of the facilities of both institutions, such as their various libraries, student residences, and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Geneva Graduate Institute <br>The facilities used by the MIDS spread across the city but are mostly concentrated in the international district as part of the "Peace Campus", with buildings just a few minutes away from most of the international organizations headquartered in Geneva.  <br> Primary Facilities  <br> Villa Moynier  <br>Villa Moynier is the shared home of the MIDS and of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, another joint center of UNIGE and of the Graduate Institute.
