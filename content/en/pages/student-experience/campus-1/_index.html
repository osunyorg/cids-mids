    <p>  <br>The MIDS is headquartered in Villa Moynier, a historic villa on the shores of Lake Geneva with a view to the Mont Blanc.  As a joint program of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva Graduate Institute (IHEID), MIDS activities take place at both institutions, in the Plainpalais area--Geneva's student district near the Old Town--for UNIGE, and at the House of Peace-- Maison de la Paix  in French--in the International Organizations district for the Graduate Institute. The joint nature of the program also means that MIDS students can take full advantage of the facilities of both institutions, such as their various libraries, student residences, and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Geneva Graduate Institute <br>The facilities used by the MIDS spread across the city but are mostly concentrated in the international district as part of the "Peace Campus", with buildings just a few minutes away from most of the international organizations headquartered in Geneva.  <br> Primary Facilities  <br> Villa Moynier  <br>Villa Moynier is the shared home of the MIDS and of the  Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights , another joint center of UNIGE and of the Graduate Institute.  The Villa hosts the MIDS offices, and students sometimes attend seminars or public events in its main room, named after the late international lawyer Antonio Cassese. <br>Villa Moynier was built in 1846 and was the property of Gustave Moynier, the first President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It later hosted the League of Nations in 1926 and served as headquarters for the ICRC from 1933 to 1946. </p>  <p> The "Maison de la Paix"  <br>The "Maison de la Paix" (or "house of peace" in English), located a few minutes away from the United Nations' Palace of Nations and near most of the international organizations based in Geneva, is the main building of the Geneva Graduate Institute.  It provides state-of-the-art facilities for research and teaching, and it is where MIDS students attend a number of their classes, workshops, and public events. It is also where the Graduate Institute's main library is located. <br>The modern complex, inaugurated in 2013, is considered one of the most remarkable architectural achievements of the 21st century in French-speaking Switzerland, with its iconic glass “petals” and meticulous aesthetics. In addition to the Geneva Graduate Institute, the complex also houses a range of institutions and non-governmental organizations working on issues related to international affairs, diplomacy, and humanitarian action.</p>  <p>   <br>In addition to the Maison de la Paix, the Graduate Institute’s facilities include the lake adjacent Villa Barton and Auditorium Jacques Freymond. Villa Barton is named after Alexandra Barton-Peel, who donated the residence and surrounding park to the Swiss Confederation on the condition that the sequoia trees in the park would remain preserved. The Auditorium Jacques Freymond is located by Villa Barton.</p>  <p> Uni Mail  <br>Located in the bustling and student-friendly neighborhood of  Plainpalais , Uni Mail is the main building of the University of Geneva and houses the Faculty of Law, where MIDS students attend elective courses. UNIGE's main library as well as several cafeterias can also be found at Uni Mail. <br>The architectural design of Uni Mail is characterized by great transparency, with large volumes open to the urban environment. A massive complex, it is the largest building in Switzerland dedicated to the humanities. </p>  <p>Patrick Nouhailler, 2012 <br> Libraries  <br> The Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Library  <br>Located at the  Maison de la Paix , it is the main library of the Geneva Graduate Institute. Specialized in the field of international relations and development studies, this library houses valuable collections that reflect the disciplines taught at the Institute. In addition to its vast repository of resources and e-resources, study rooms and workstations create a perfect academic environment for students. Learn more about the library's study spaces  here . </p>  <p> Uni Mail Library  <br>The Uni Mail Library is the largest of several libraries of the University of Geneva located around the city. In addition to vast study spaces, it also allows MIDS students to benefit from a wide array of resources and offerings within the field of international law and beyond.</p>  <p>Jacques Erard, 2015 <br> Student Spaces  <br> The Fab  <br>Located inside the  Maison de la Paix , the "Fab"--short for French "Fabrique de la paix"--is a combination of a student lounge and an innovation lab. With exhibition spaces, as well as lounge, study, and meeting spots, it is meant to be a space for students to study, socialize, and work together towards common initiatives and projects.  The Fab also hosts a number of events throughout the years organized by the Graduate Institute and its community.</p>  <p>Geneva Graduate Institute <br> Picciotto Common Room  <br>The Geneva Graduate Institute's main student common space, it is located on the ground floor of the Picciotto student residence, a short walk away from the  Maison de la Paix .
