Librarians are also available to respond to questions and assist students in their research. Trainings and workshops to further your research skills are also offered throughout the academic year--independently of research support offered by the MIDS.</p>  <p> IT Services  <br>   <br>With dedicated email addresses and university platforms to track studies, students have access to a whole suite of advanced educational software.

Just like any international city, English is enough to get by comfortably in most situations outside the classroom. But we also encourage students to start developing some rudimentary French skills even before coming to Geneva, through independent study. Once in Geneva, students have the opportunity to enroll in French courses provided by our parent institutions.</p>  <p> Learn more </p>
