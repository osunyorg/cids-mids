        <p>The MIDS is headquartered in Villa Moynier, a historic villa on the shores of Lake Geneva with a view to the Mont Blanc. However, as a joint program of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva Graduate Institute (IHEID), MIDS activities take place at both institutions, in the Painpalais area--Geneva's student district near the Old Town--for UNIGE, and at the House of Peace--<i>Maison de la Paix</i> in French--in the International Organizations district for the Graduate Institute.</p><p>The joint nature of the program also means that MIDS students can take full advantage of the facilities of both institutions, such as their various libraries, student residences, or sports facilities.</p>

        <p>Villa Moynier is the shared home of the MIDS and of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, another joint center of UNIGE and of the Graduate Institute. While the Villa is home primarily to the MIDS offices, students often attend a handful of classes, workshops, or public events in its main room named after the late international lawyer Antonio Cassese.<br></p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Villa Moynier was built in 1846 and was the property of Gustave Moynier, the first President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It later hosted the League of Nations in 1926 and served as headquarters for the ICRC from 1933 to 1946. <br></p>

        <p>The "Maison de la Paix" (or "house of peace" in English), located a few minutes away from the United Nations' Palace of Nations and near most of the International Organizations based in Geneva, is the main building of the Geneva Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. It provides state-of-the-art facilities for research and teaching, and it is where MIDS students attend a number of their classes as well as public events. It is also where the Graduate Institute's main library is located.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>The modern complex, inaugurated in 2013, is considered one of the most remarkable architectural achievements of the 21st century in French-speaking Switzerland, with its iconic glass “petals” and meticulous aesthetics. In addition to the Geneva Graduate Institute, the complex also houses a range of institutions and non-governmental organizations working on issues related to international affairs, diplomacy, and humanitarian action.<br></p>
