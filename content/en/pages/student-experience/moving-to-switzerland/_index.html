            Understand the cost of living

          description: >-
            <p>Switzerland is known for its high cost of living. Though on par with many other large international cities or university towns, life in Geneva and Switzerland is experience. Budgeting carefully and realistically ahead of time can help the experience feel less frustrating and more enjoyable.</p>

        <p>As is always the case when moving somewhere new, moving to Switzerland as an international student will almost inevitably involve quite a bit of paperwork and administrative steps. The more organized and prepared you are, the easier it will feel.</p>

            Stay organized

            <p>The range of steps you will need to take, forms you will need to fill out, and documents you will need to provide can easily become confusing and overwhelming. Make sure you organize yourself as early as possible to keep track of all the procedures and documents you need.</p>

            Pay attention to deadlines

          description: >-
            <p>Keeping track of the documents and procedures is one thing, but you will usually need to complete specific steps at specific times or within specific windows. It is easy to miss deadlines, but it can be very difficult to fix things afterwards. So make sure you are aware and keeping track of deadlines you need to comply with.</p>

            Allow yourself time to rest

          description: >-
            <p>Balancing the excitement of moving with the demands of wrapping up your work or studies at home is crucial. Make sure to schedule regular breaks and downtime to rest and recharge throughout the process of preparing for the move, and after you have moved. Once you are here, this could be as simple as taking a walk along Lake Geneva, practicing physical activities, or enjoying some quiet time aside from all the activities we will have planned for you. Prioritizing rest will help you maintain your energy and focus.</p>

            Give yourself enough buffer time

          description: >-
            <p>When planning your move and your schedule, always allow for buffer time between commitments. We especially encourage you to come to Geneva sufficiently ahead of the start of the academic year. This extra time can be invaluable for handling unexpected delays, settling into your new home, or simply taking a moment to breathe. Buffer time helps reduce stress and ensures you can manage your responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

          description: >-
            <p>Building connections with your future classmates is an essential part of your graduate experience. Engage in online forums, attend virtual meetups, and participate in pre-arrival events. These interactions not only enhance your learning but also create a support network that can be invaluable once you arrive in Geneva.</p>

          description: >-
            <p>Take advantage of the initial weeks before your academic schedule becomes intense to explore and enjoy your new surroundings. Visit local attractions, try new foods, and immerse yourself in the local culture. This exploration will help you feel more at home and provide a solid foundation for when your studies become more demanding.</p>
