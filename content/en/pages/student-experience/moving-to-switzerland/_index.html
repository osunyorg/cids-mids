            Educate yourself about life in Switzerland

          description: >-
            In addition to the resources you can find on our website and the informations we will provide you with ahead of time, there is plenty of information you can find online or by asking friends or MIDS alumni and that will help you better understand what to expect and how to prepare.

            Manage your expectations

            Whether you are excited or anxious about moving to Geneva, make sure you manage your expectations one way or the other: do not be overly anxious or overly confident.

            Understand the cost of living

          description: >-
            Switzerland is known for its high cost of living. Though on par with many other large international cities or university towns, life in Geneva and Switzerland is experience. Budgeting carefully and realistically ahead of time can help the experience feel less frustrating and more enjoyable.

            Prepare for unexpected challenges

          description: >-
            Another key is to prepare yourself for potential challenges. Whether it is about your travel plans, your accommodation, and your love ones, many unexpected things can happen by the time you start the MIDS. Prepare yourself mentally and practically for possible challenges, to be equipped to handle them appropriately.

            Learn basic French

          description: >-
            While the MIDS is entirely in English and you can easily get by in Geneva without speaking a word of French, getting some basic knowledge can be incredibly helpful for daily interactions and to make your new environement more familiar and less intimidating.

        <p>As is always the case when moving somewhere new, moving to Switzerland as an international student will almost inevitably involve quite a bit of paperwork and administrative steps. The more organized and prepared you are, the easier it will feel.</p>

            Stay organized

          description: >-
            The range of steps you will need to take, forms you will need to fill out, and documents you will need to provide can easily become confusing and overwhelming. Make sure you organize yourself as early as possible to keep track of all the procedures and documents you need.

            Pay attention to deadlines

          description: >-
            Keeping track of the documents and procedures is one thing, but you will usually need to complete specific steps at specific times or within specific windows. It is easy to miss deadlines, but it can be very difficult to fix things afterwards. So make sure you are aware and keeping track of deadlines you need to comply with.
