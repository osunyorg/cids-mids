        <p>The MIDS administration does its best to help all new students secure spots in local student accommodations, which are highly sought after due to their preferential pricing, competitive locations and additional student services.</p><p>The rooms available vary in size, price, conditions, location, and services available. They are located within the Graduate Institute’s Student Residences (Picciotto and Grand Morillon), Résidence Universitaire Internationale (Rothschild, Carlton and La Voie Creuse) and the Cité Universitaire de Genève (more information below).</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Students remain free to secure their own housing or opt for ordinary rental arrangements. However, we must caution that Geneva is one of the world’s most expensive cities, with an overcrowded housing market. We encourage those who prefer to seek their own accommodation to do their research and to start early.<br></p>
