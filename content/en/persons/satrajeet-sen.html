  <p>Satrajeet is an India-qualified lawyer with extensive experience in dispute resolution. Prior to joining the MIDS, he was working as counsel at the chambers of a Senior Advocate in India.

He has regularly appeared as arguing counsel in arbitrations and related court proceedings, including proceedings for appointing arbitrators, securing interim reliefs, setting aside and enforcing arbitral awards. <br><br>Beyond arbitrations, Satrajeet has represented parties in a wide spectrum of disputes, including commercial suits, insolvency proceedings and constitutional cases before courts and tribunals. He has also drafted legal opinions on various complex queries presented by solicitor firms and clients. Notably, he also served as amicus curiae to the appellate commercial division bench of the Calcutta High Court to address the scope of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in relation to eviction suits. <br> <br>Satrajeet holds an undergraduate degree in law from the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata, one of India’s premier national law schools.
