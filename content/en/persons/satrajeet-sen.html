  <p>Satrajeet is an India-qualified lawyer with extensive experience in dispute resolution. Prior to joining the MIDS, he was working as counsel at the chambers of a Senior Advocate in India. As counsel, Satrajeet has experience in conducting legal research, drafting pleadings, arguing matters, cross-examinations, working in teams and formulating case strategies. He has regularly appeared as arguing counsel in arbitrations and related court proceedings, including proceedings for appointing arbitrators, securing interim reliefs, setting aside and enforcing arbitral awards. <br><br>Beyond arbitrations, Satrajeet has represented parties in a wide spectrum of disputes, including commercial suits, insolvency proceedings and constitutional cases before courts and tribunals. He has also drafted legal opinions on various complex queries presented by solicitor firms and clients. Notably, he also served as amicus curiae to the commercial appellate division bench of the Calcutta High Court to address the scope of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in relation to eviction suits. <br> <br>Satrajeet holds an undergraduate degree in law from the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata, one of India’s premier national law schools.

During his internship with Mr Gourab Banerji, Senior Advocate and Overseas Associate, Essex Court Chambers, he assisted in drafting written notes of submissions before a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in NN Global (2023) 7 SCC 1, a landmark case concerning the appointment of arbitrators under unstamped arbitration agreements. <br><br>Satrajeet has also published research papers in reputed journals and legal platforms. As a student, he represented his university at both national and global rounds of the 2021 FDI International Arbitration Moot Court and later coached teams in the subsequent three editions. <br><br>Apart from law, Satrajeet is an avid sports enthusiast with keen interest in playing and following cricket and football.</p><p> <b>Nationality</b></p><p>India</p><p> <b>Working Languages </b>  </p><p>English<br>Hindi<br>Bengali</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise</b></p><p>Arbitration<br>Commercial Litigation<br>Insolvency and Bankruptcy Law</p><p> <b>Bar Information</b></p><p>West Bengal, India, 2024<b><br></b><br><b><br></b><br></p>
