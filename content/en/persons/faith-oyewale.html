biography: >-
  <p>Faith is a Nigerian-qualified lawyer with half a decade of experience in Commercial Dispute Resolution (Arbitration & Litigation) and International Trade & Investment Law. He is currently in the process of getting qualified in England & Wales. He is a recipient of Jan Paulsson's scholarship to pursue his studies at the MIDS. </p><p>Before commencing his studies at the MIDS, Faith worked as an Associate at AELEX (ranked as a top-tier law firm by IFLR) where he cut his teeth in international commercial dispute resolution. He was instrumental in establishing a ‘locus classicus’ by successfully defending University of Oxford in a civil action for negligence claims which explored Nigeria’s legal jurisprudence on the limitation of a publisher’s liability in the tort of negligence.  In recognition of his contributions to the Nigerian legal system, he was nominated as a Rising Star (the only Nigerian and in spite of being just three years at the Bar) by the African Legal Awards in 2022; an award event held in Johannesburg, South Africa. Also assured of his potential in international commercial dispute, he became the only Nigerian to be selected by the American Arbitration Association and International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA-ICDR) to act as a lead counsel in the Control Risks Virtual Cross Examination Training. </p><p>Faith obtained a Bachelor of Laws with Honours from Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria. He participated in different domestic and international competitions and on many occasions led his college team, emerging as the Best Counsel in 13 competitions. He notably represented Nigeria and West Africa at the 4th Herbert Smith Freehills, International Negotiation Competition (INC), New Delhi, India, in 2017, whereafter his team was presented with the “Spirit of the Competition” award which according to the organisers symbolised the team that best approximated the ideals of negotiation. He also participated as an Oralist at the John H. Jackson World Trade Moot Competition at the Kenya School of Law, Nairobi, Kenya, in 2019. </p><p><b>Nationality </b></p><p>Nigeria </p><p><b>Working Languages </b></p><p>English </p><p><b>Areas of Expertise </b></p><p>International Commercial Arbitration </p><p>Investment Arbitration </p><p>International Dispute Settlement </p><p>Civil and Commercial Litigation </p><p>International Trade and Investment Law </p><p><b>Bar Information </b></p><p>Lagos, Nigeria, 2019 </p>
