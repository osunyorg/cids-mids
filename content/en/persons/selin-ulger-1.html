biography: >-
  <p>Selin is a Turkish-qualified lawyer with a professional background in cross-border finance and an emerging specialization in international dispute settlement. Before joining the MIDS, she practiced at GKC Partners, the Istanbul office of White & Case LLP, where she advised leading global and domestic clients on acquisition finance, project finance, and debt restructuring mandates, contributing to some of the most significant transactions in the Turkish market. Her work on large-scale energy, infrastructure and construction projects offered her an in-depth understanding of how risk allocation, contractual structuring, and negotiation dynamics shape international transactions – insights she now brings to her work in international dispute resolution.<br><br>While her work experience has been in banking and finance so far, Selin’s interest in international dispute settlement and public international law has been longstanding. Prior to joining White & Case, she gained hands-on experience in dispute resolution through internships at top international law firms in Istanbul, including Baker McKenzie, where she assisted in the management of both commercial and investor-state disputes. During her undergraduate studies, Selin complemented her legal training with graduate-level courses on investment treaty arbitration and published two articles in Koç University’s peer-reviewed law journal, examining treaty-making practices and globalization trends in international dispute settlement. She also recently delivered a guest lecture on cyberspace and its implications for the traditional principles of public international law, reflecting her engagement with the evolving frontiers of the field.<br> <br>Selin holds both an LL.B. and a B.A. in International Relations from Koç University, graduating with honors in 2023. During her studies, she represented Koç University in the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, where her team placed 7th in the White & Case International Preliminary Rounds, and she was individually recognized as the 30th Best Oralist worldwide. She later returned as coach to the 2023 Koç University team, which went on to win the Turkish National Championship for a second consecutive year under her mentorship. Selin also participated in the 15th edition of the Frankfurt Investment Arbitration Moot Court Competition, where her team became the first from Türkiye to reach the Round of 16. For the past two years, she has been serving as the National Administrator of the Jessup Türkiye National Rounds and remains dedicated to strengthening and expanding the moot court community across the country.<br><br>Having started her career on the transactional side of legal services, Selin now seeks to leverage her exposure to complex financing structures and contractual frameworks in addressing the challenges of international commercial and investment disputes. In the meantime, however, she will continue to immerse herself in classic literature, theatre so layered that an existential crisis feels inevitable, and the occasional debate on whether international law can ever be truly apolitical.<br><br><b>Nationality<br></b>Turkey</p><p> <b>Working Languages </b></p><p>Turkish<br>English</p><p><b>Areas of Expertise </b></p><p>International Arbitration<br>Public International Law <br>Banking Finance <br>Project Finance <br>Debt Restructuring <br>Corporate Law </p><p> <b>Bar Information<br></b>2024, Turkey<b><br></b> </p>
