biography: >-
  <p>Mitansh is an Indian-qualified lawyer with four years of experience in dispute resolution. After graduating from Government Law College, Mumbai, in 2021, he joined AZB & Partners, where he has navigated arbitrations seated across Singapore, Dubai, and Mumbai, working with both institutional rules and ad-hoc mechanisms with equal enthusiasm. His practice spans appearances before courts and tribunals across India, tackling complex cross-border disputes, private wealth matters and regulatory matters.<br><br>Beyond courtroom advocacy, Mitansh has contributed to academic discourse, co-authoring a publication on international arbitration. He has assisted (Retd.) Justice Indu Malhotra in drafting a chapter on investment treaty arbitration for Malhotra’s Commentary on Law of Arbitration (4th ed., Wolters Kluwer), and has served as junior editor of Datuk Sundra Rajoo's Law, Practice and Procedure of Arbitration in India (Thomson Reuters).<br><br>A ‘Bombay Kid,’ Mitansh had never lived outside Mumbai until the MIDS beckoned him to Geneva, a transition he describes as “swapping the Mumbai local for Swiss punctuality, but keeping the same passion for heated arguments.” <br><br>When not buried in case files, he enjoys surfing (despite still working on his open-water swimming credentials) and playing the drums, which he maintains is “the easiest instrument to learn, just ask my neighbors.”</p><p> <b>Nationality </b>  </p><p>India</p><p> <b>Working Languages</b></p><p>Hindi<br>English<b><br></b></p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise</b></p><p>Commercial Litigation & International Arbitration<br>Financial Services Regulation<br>Insolvency & Bankruptcy Law</p><p> <b>Bar Information</b></p><p>Mumbai, India, 2021</p>
