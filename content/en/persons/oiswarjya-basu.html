biography: >-
  <p>           Oiswarjya is an Indian-qualified lawyer with over six years of experience in dispute settlement, shaped by a blend of both practice and academia. Before joining the MIDS as a CIDS Foundation Scholar, she was an Assistant Professor at Jindal Global Law School, teaching Alternative Dispute Resolution, Law of Contracts, a self-curated elective on Energy Disputes & International Arbitration, and a clinic on Drafting, Pleadings, & Conveyancing. During this time, she also published articles, including in Kluwer Arbitration, peer-reviewed for a leading journal, and coached and judged international moot court teams.<br> Her experience also includes serving as a Counsel at the Office of the Advocate-on-Record for the State of West Bengal, where she advised and represented a diverse portfolio of government and private clients in complex litigation and commercial arbitration across sectors such as construction, energy, banking, real estate and technology. She regularly appeared before the Calcutta High Court and various tribunals, handling primarily domestic ad-hoc arbitrations alongside select Singapore-seated cases, which equipped her in navigating LCIA and SIAC Rules. She has also worked on civil suits, insolvency proceedings, and constitutional matters, while consistently maintaining an independent practice as a drafting counsel.<br> In her role as a Fellow at the Centre for International Investment and Trade Laws (CIITL), she spearheaded and moderated projects with international practitioners and scholars such as Dr. B.S. Chimni, Mr. Baiju Vasani, and Ms. Niuscha Bassiri, in an attempt to advance the ISDS discourse in India - a cause she is deeply passionate about.<br> Oiswarjya completed her LL.M in International Economic Law from SOAS University of London as the William Ross Murray Scholar and went on to receive the Yusuf Ali Grant for her dissertation. Additionally, she served as a Research Assistant to Dr. Emilia Onyema, Professor of International Commercial Arbitration at SOAS. She graduated with a B.A.LL.B (Hons.) from the University of Calcutta, where she topped, among other modules, the course on ADR.  </p><p><br> <b>Nationality<br>India</b>   </p><p><b>Working Languages</b> <br>English<br> Hindi<br> Bangla   </p><p><b>Areas of Expertise<br> </b>Commercial Litigation and Arbitration<br> Investment Treaty Arbitration<br> Contract Law<br> Insolvency & Bankruptcy Law<br> Construction & Energy Disputes<br> Law of Torts   </p><p><b>Bar Information<br> </b>India, 2018          </p>
