biography: >-
  <p>Nathalie Kostara is a Greek trainee lawyer whose work spans international arbitration, trade law, and the broader field of dispute settlement. She holds an LL.B. and an LL.M. in International and European Law from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and she will obtain her license to the Athens Bar in May 2026.<br><br>Her professional experience bridges both the diplomatic and private practice dimensions of dispute resolution. Her current practice as a trainee lawyer in Athens exposes her to commercial, tax, and public procurement disputes, where she has gained experience in arbitration, mediation, and amicable settlements. Being involved in litigation for a large multinational inspection-certification company exposed her to the intricacies of international legal dispute resolution, particularly when navigating conflict of laws and cross-border negotiations.<br><br>In parallel, at the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations in New York, she advised on the work of the Third and Fifth Committees, drafted official reports and had the chance to obtain firsthand exposure to multilateral negotiations and consensus-building work. She contributed to negotiations behind two biannual resolutions sponsored by Greece at the 76th UN General Assembly and supported the Mission during the elections for the International Court of Justice, working on the campaign of Professor Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos, who eventually also became her thesis supervisor. <br><br>Alongside practice, Nathalie pursues academic research at the intersection of trade, equality, and international law. She has presented her research papers on gender-responsive public procurement and WTO law at the IEL4Inclusion Final Conference in Athens (2025) and on gender identity rights at the University of Malta LGBTIQ Symposium (2023). She also served as editor of the De Jure Legal Journal, focusing on developments at the ICJ, ICC, and PCA, and participated in the 10th ELSA National Moot court Competition on Civil litigation where her and her team conquered the second place. <br><br>Nathalie has a strong record of leadership and civic engagement. She has organized and mentored through the European Youth Parliament and Understanding Europe programs, and has extensive experience as a delegate, chair, and trainer in Model United Nations conferences across Europe. She is also a member of the general assembly of the Hellenic Children's Museum. <br>Beyond her legal career, Nathalie enjoys hiking, history of art, and being a proud bookworm in the digital age.</p><p> <b>Nationalities</b></p><p>Greece<br>Cyprus </p><p><b>Working Languages</b></p><p>English<br>French<br>Greek</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise </b></p><p>European Law<br>International Law<br>Trade Law<br>Contract Law</p>
