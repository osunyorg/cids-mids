biography: >-
  <p>Mohit is an Indian-qualified lawyer with over three years of experience in commercial dispute resolution and white-collar investigations. Prior to joining the MIDS, he practised with Trilegal, a leading GAR 100 law firm, representing clients in international and domestic arbitrations and appearing before various forums, including the Supreme Court of India, the Delhi High Court and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. At Trilegal, Mohit’s experience spanned from institutional international arbitrations to conducting an anti-bribery and anti-corruption investigation, his work increasingly focused on commercial disputes and resolving special situations.<br><br>A 2022 graduate from Gujarat National Law University, Mohit was drawn towards subjects such as International Commercial Arbitration, Competition Law, and Corporate Law. He has published articles on EU Law and Indian Competition Law with Kluwer and has contributed to the discourse on decentralized social networks and its impact on content moderation and free speech through his work with Columbia Global Freedom of Expression. Beyond the classroom, he engaged in a range of co-curricular activities, serving as the Senior Editor for the University’s flagship Journal of Law and Economics and as a teaching assistant, conducting sessions for his juniors.<br><br>Having navigated Delhi’s busy streets and questionable air quality, Mohit now finds himself among Swiss cows, embracing the calm they symbolize. When not deciphering the fine print, he can usually be found chasing a good coffee, football, or higher altitudes, anything that does not come with a deadline.</p><p> <b>Nationality</b>  </p><p>India</p><p> <b>Working Languages </b>  </p><p> English<br>Hindi</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise </b>  </p><p>Commercial Litigation & International Arbitration<br>Financial Regulatory<br>White Collar Crime</p><p> <b>Bar Information</b></p><p>India, 2022</p>
