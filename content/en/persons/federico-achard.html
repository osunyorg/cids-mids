He has published articles on investment arbitration and procedural law and has spoken at events about commercial and investment arbitration organized by UNCITRAL. He is currently serving as a research assistant at Universidad de la República, where, together with a group of international academics, he is analyzing the use of comparative law arguments by the Uruguayan Supreme Court.</p><p>He is enthusiastically involved in pro bono work, having participated in an extracurricular law clinic assisting low-income families in judicial proceedings while pursuing his law degree.</p><p><b>Bar Information </b></p><p>Uruguay, 2022 </p>
