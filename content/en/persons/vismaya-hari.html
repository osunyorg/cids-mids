  <p>Vismaya Hari is an India-qualified lawyer with a sustained engagement in commercial disputes and international arbitration. She recently completed her LL.M. in International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution at the National University of Singapore (NUS), where she was nominated by the University to the NUS–MIDS double-degree program.<br><br>Before joining MIDS, Vismaya worked as an Associate at a dispute resolution firm in Mumbai, handling high-value arbitration and commercial litigation matters before the High Court of Bombay, the National Company Law Tribunal, and various arbitral tribunals. Her work spanned high-value construction and shareholder disputes, asset purchase agreements and cases involving allegations of fraud and collusion. She has also gained exposure through national and international internships, including with the International Arbitration Teams at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr (London) and PD Legal (Singapore).<br><br>Her academic and research pursuits complement her practice experience. As a Research Assistant to Gary Born, she contributed to the forthcoming publication International Law in American Courts, where she organized and analyzed over 5,000 authorities to support key arguments in the work. She is also the co-founder and editor of the ADR Newsletter of the Indian Law Society’s Centre for Arbitration.<br><br>Vismaya earned her B.A., LL.B.

Her off-duty interests include furiously petting cats, collecting perfumes she insists are all essential, and curating oddly specific Spotify playlists that no one asked for. </p><p> <b>Nationality</b><br>India</p><p> <b>Working Languages </b><br>English<br>Hindi</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise<br></b>International Arbitration<br>Energy, Construction and Infrastructure Disputes<br>Investment Treaty Arbitration</p><p> <b>Bar Information </b><br>Mumbai, India, 2023   </p>
