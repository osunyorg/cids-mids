  <p>Naa Adjah is a Ghanaian qualified lawyer with four years’ experience as a disputes lawyer. Prior to joining the MIDS she worked with Amofa & Partners, a boutique law firm in Accra, Ghana. Her legal practice was focused on domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration, commercial litigation and arbitration related litigation such as the challenge of arbitrators’ jurisdiction and the challenge or enforcement of both domestic and international arbitral awards. <br><br>Her legal practice in arbitration transcends acting as counsel. She also regularly acted as tribunal secretary for arbitral tribunals at the Ghana Arbitration Centre (the leading arbitral institution in Ghana) where she conducted legal research for arbitral tribunals as well as provided administrative assistance to arbitral tribunals. She was also occasionally engaged to train officials of public institutions on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as negotiation and mediation. <br><br>Prior to joining Amofa & Partners, Naa Adjah worked with Ghana’s Ministry of Justice and Attorney General’s Department where she had the opportunity to assist the Attorney General’s office in defending two major international arbitration claims against the Government of Ghana conducted before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA).<br><br>Naa Adjah has a Bachelor of Laws (LL. B) degree from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) and a Qualifying Certificate to practise law in Ghana from the Ghana School of Law. Her most recent qualification in arbitration was gotten from an intense training by the Africa Arbitration Academy where she acquired a Diploma in International Arbitration. She also has a Diploma in French Language Studies. She has interests in international commercial arbitration, investor-state arbitration and international trade law and policy. Naa Adjah is a member of the Ghana Bar Association, the LCIA African Users’ Council and the Association of Young Arbitrators (AYA). <br></p><p> <b>Nationality </b>  </p><p>Ghana</p><p> <b>Working Languages</b></p><p>English<br>French</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise</b></p><p>International Commercial Arbitration<br>Commercial Litigation</p><p> <b>Bar Information</b></p><p>Accra, Ghana, 2021</p>
