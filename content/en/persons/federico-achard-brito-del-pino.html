  <p>Federico is a Uruguayan lawyer with over five years of experience in international arbitration and litigation. Before joining the MIDS as a CIDS Scholar, he was working at Gaillard Banifatemi Shelbaya Disputes, where he participated in the defense of Latin American states in investment arbitration proceedings.</p><p>His prior experience also includes working for the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, and Ferrere Abogados. This diverse background has exposed him to the application of commonly used arbitration rules — including UNCITRAL, ICSID, HKIAC, and SIAC — in proceedings related to some of the most relevant economic sectors, including energy, tax and construction arbitrations.</p><p>Federico also served as assistant professor of Civil Law at Universidad de la República, his alma mater, for several years. He has published articles on investment arbitration and procedural law and has spoken at events about commercial and investment arbitration organized by UNCITRAL. He is currently serving as a research assistant at Universidad de la República, where, together with a group of international academics, he is analyzing the use of comparative law arguments by the Uruguayan Supreme Court.</p><p>He is enthusiastically involved in pro bono work, having participated in an extracurricular law clinic assisting low-income families in judicial proceedings while pursuing his law degree.</p><p><b>Bar Information </b></p><p>Uruguay, 2022 </p>
