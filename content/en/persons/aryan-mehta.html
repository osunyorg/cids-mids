biography: >-
  <p>Aryan Mehta is an Indian-qualified lawyer who practiced as an associate in a premier dispute resolution team at one of India’s leading law firms before joining the MIDS, focusing on international commercial arbitrations and complex commercial litigations. He worked extensively as part of a small, focused team on ad-hoc arbitrations representing the Government of India, developing skills in research, drafting, and document review, both manually and using AI tools.<br><br>He holds a dual degree in Law (LL.B.) and Business Administration (B.B.A.) from Jindal Global Law School, graduating in 2024. During his studies, he represented the university at multiple international moot court competitions, ranking first in his batch for mooting. Aryan was part of the first Jindal team to win the national rounds of the International Criminal Court Moot Court Competition, an achievement he repeated the following year, leading to two successive appearances at the global rounds, including a quarterfinal finish in 2023. In 2024, he competed in the 21st Willem C. Vis (East) Moot Court Competition, where his team ranked first in the preliminary rounds, advanced to the octa-finals, and he was individually ranked among the top ten speakers. It was here that he cemented his interest in international commercial arbitration, particularly the interplay between industry-specific practices and legal strategy that shapes the course of disputes.<br><br>Aryan also gained broad experience through internships at leading law firms, working on international and domestic arbitrations, both ad-hoc and institutional, alongside competition law and commercial litigation. This practical exposure is complemented by his academic engagements, including publications in public international law, international commercial arbitration, and investment arbitration. He has a particular interest in investor-state disputes, state-state disputes, and international commercial disputes, aiming to establish himself as a specialist in international dispute settlement.<br><br>Outside the law, Aryan enjoys Indian mythology, cricket, and long-distance running. He is fluent in English and Hindi and is currently advancing his intermediate French skills.</p><p> <b>Nationality </b>  </p><p>India</p><p> <b>Working Languages </b>  </p><p>English</p><p> <b>Areas of Expertise </b>  </p><p>International Commercial Arbitration<br>International Investment Arbitration<br>Public International Law</p><p> <b>Bar Information </b>  </p><p> New Delhi, India, 2024</p>
