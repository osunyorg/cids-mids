His practice encompasses international arbitration public international law and general commercial litigation. He has represented or advised private parties and states under all the major arbitral rules including the ICC, LCIA, SCC, ICSID, UNCITRAL and DIAC rules, in a range of sectors including construction, oil and gas, mining, banking, insurance and reinsurance and telecommunications and energy. His experience includes acting for some of the world's largest companies in high value complex arbitrations involving disputes around the world. He also sits as an arbitrator and has been appointed by the LCIA and ICC to do so in a number of disputes. In 2012 he was nominated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.

He is also adept at dealing with political cases involving states and state owned entities.

His book Unjust Enrichment and Contract (Hart, Oxford, 2009) is cited in leading English texts, including Chitty on Contracts and Goff and Jones: The law of Unjust Enrichment, and was described by the professor of English law at Oxford as the "definitive" work in the area.
