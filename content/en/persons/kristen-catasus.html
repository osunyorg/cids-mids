In addition, she has advised on the resolution of operational disruptions within the supply chain, including claims related to performance failures-often through contract enforcement, negotiated settlements, or risk mitigation strategies. Kristen has also managed internal corporate investigations and acted as a liaison with local, state, and federal regulatory agencies in connection with inquiries involving fraud and antitrust violations.<br><br>Kristen earned a bachelor’s degree in Criminology and International Relations from the University of Florida in Gainesville, and a Juris Doctor from Florida International University College of Law in Miami.
