        <p>For this project, we worked with the Paris-based <a href="https://www.noesya.coop" target="_blank">Noesya<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> firm. Noesya is cooperative bringing together independent web designers and developers committed to developing high-quality, modern, secure and data-privacy-aware, as well as environment-friendly websites. The experienced team at Noesya, has worked for several years to develop its own custom CMS (content management system), designed specifically for universities and other educational institutions. More than just a website, the new CIDS/MIDS websites are therefore part of a movement to develop more ethical and responsible websites that cater to the specific needs of education. Significant efforts were also made to comply with the highest standards of accessibility, especially for visitors with disabilities or visual impairments, as well as to comply with the most stringent data-privacy regulations.... We could not be happier to have gotten the chance to be part of this project.</p><p>The design of the new CIDS and MIDS websites--that are now two distinct websites--was conceived by French designer Takumi Kobayashi, from <a href="https://www.cmjnrvb.net" target="_blank">cmjnrvb creative studio<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>. Takumi is a respected web designer, known for some major projects in recent years, including the Harvard &amp; the Legacy of slavery website. Takumi's design for the CIDS and MIDS websites aimed to capture the identity of the CIDS and the MIDS and convey information in a simple, clear, and refined fashion. The color schemes chosen borrow from the environment in which we are located, in particular Villa Moynier, overlooking the lake and the Alps in the distance, with the use of beige recalling the colors of the Salève mountain as well as the stones of Villa Moynier, the white mirroring the snowy Mont Blanc chain in the distance as well as Geneva's famous Jet d'Eau fountain, and shades of blue, an obvious reference to the lake which is at the heart of Geneva's identity. For the fonts, Takumi chose, among others, the Rand typography, made by Swiss company.... and echoing one of the most famous fonts every designed, Helvetica, created in 1957 by Swiss type designer Max Miedinger. Finally, Takumi decided to highlight the symbol of the CIDS and MIDS since their creation, a globe that represents.... </p><p>The whole CIDS and MIDS team was involved in the redesign, with a desire to streamline information and make </p><p>We are delighted to have collaborated with Noesya and cmjnrvb studio on this project, and we hope our users will appreciate.</p>
