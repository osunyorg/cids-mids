        <p>After close to 6 months of work, we are delighted to launch our new websites--plural, since the MIDS now has its own website (<a href="mids.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mids.ch <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>), separate from that of the CIDS (<a href="cids.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cids.ch <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>).</p><p><b>This project, which was initiated by former MIDS Program Director <a href="https://mids.ch/team/prof-laurence-boisson-de-chazournes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Laurence Boisson de Chazournes <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> and carried out under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://mids.ch/en/team/prof-zachary-douglas-kc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zachary Douglas <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, has involved the whole MIDS team over several months and in many different ways. It would not have been possible, however, without the hard work and leadership of our Program Manager, <a href="https://mids.ch/team/callie-cunningham/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Callie Cunningham <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, and the critical support of our Administrative Assistant <a href="https://mids.ch/en/team/nolwenn-marchaland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nolwenn Marchaland <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>. </b></p>

        <p>After an extremely thorough selection process, we picked Paris-based firm <a href="https://www.noesya.coop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Noesya <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> to be responsible for the redesign. </p><p>Noesya is a cooperative bringing together independent web designers and developers committed to developing high-quality, modern, functional, but also--and importantly for us--secure, data-privacy-conscious, as well as environment-friendly websites. Noesya's passionate team also includes university lecturers and researchers in communication, web and graphic design, evidencing a genuine commitment to their mission.</p><p>Key to our decision to partner with Noesya, its experienced team worked for several years to develop its own custom CMS (content management system), designed specifically for universities and other educational and research institutions. An ambitious and unique project, the custom CMS, <a href="https://www.osuny.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Osuny <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, is meant to allow for a smooth user experience, but also to ensure that university websites meet the highest possible standards in accessibility, security, and energy efficiency--so as to help minimize their carbon footprint. Alongside Osuny, comes a network of schools and users who meet once a month to share their experiences, questions, and discuss possible improvements. </p><p>More than just a website, the new CIDS/MIDS websites are therefore part of a <b>broader movement to develop more ethical and responsible websites that meet the specific needs of educational institutions</b>. We could not be happier to be part of this project.</p>

          The websites' design
        heading: 2
    data:
      layout: no_background
      text: >-
        <p>The design of the new websites was conceived by French designer Takumi Kobayashi, from <a href="https://www.cmjnrvb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cmjnrvb creative studio <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>. Takumi is a respected web designer, known for some major projects in recent years, including the <a href="https://legacyofslavery.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Harvard & the Legacy of slavery <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> website, which was nominated for a <a href="https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/apps-software/general-apps/public-service-activism/248589/harvard--the-legacy-of-slavery-tour-experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Webby Award <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> in 2023. </p><p><b>Takumi's elegant and minimalist design for our websites aimed to capture the identity of the CIDS and the MIDS and convey information in a simple, clear, and refined fashion</b>. </p><p>The color scheme chosen borrows from the environment in which we are located, in particular Villa Moynier, overlooking the lake and the Alps in the distance, with the use of beige recalling the colors of the Salève mountain as well as the stones of Villa Moynier, the white mirroring the snowy Mont Blanc chain in the distance as well as Geneva's famous Jet d'Eau fountain, and shades of blue, an obvious reference to the lake which is at the heart of Geneva's identity. </p><p>For the original fonts used across the websites, Takumi chose in particular the <a href="https://optimo.ch/typefaces/rand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rand <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> typeface, designed by the Swiss foundry <a href="https://optimo.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Optimo <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, based in Geneva. Reminiscent of one of the most famous typefaces ever designed, Helvetica--created in 1957 by Swiss type designer Max Miedinger--Rand combines the efficiency and clarity of Swiss Rationalism, with subtle warmer and more modern touches.</p><p>Finally, Takumi decided to highlight the globe motif present in the CIDS and MIDS logos, first adopted in 2008. The symbol represents the international nature of the CIDS and MIDS, the global reach of our community, and the interconnectedness of today’s world. The seemingly endless thread circling in the shape of a globe, arranged in neatly organized waves and loops, symbolizes the continuity of law and its attempt to provide coherence in a turbulent world, as well as its inherently living and evolving nature. The symbol's general roundness also evokes the goals of international dispute settlement, which aims to facilitate the peaceful resolution of disputes. Yet, at the same time, the motif’s somewhat busy aesthetic reminds us of the complexity of both the world and the law, which the CIDS and MIDS precisely aim to untangle in their activities.</p><p><b>We are delighted to have collaborated with Noesya and cmjnrvb studio on this project, and we hope that our community as well as those learning about us for the first time will enjoy the new websites.</b></p>
