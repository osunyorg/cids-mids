    MIDS Academic Retreat at the Château de Bossey A unique learning experience

      <p> </p>  <p>On  1-2 December <br>2025 , the LL.M Master in International Dispute Settlement program held its annual  Academic Retreat  at the <br>historic  Château de Bossey , an 18th-century estate nestled in the Swiss <br>countryside between Versoix and Nyon for <br>two days of intensive learning and networking.</p>  <p>The retreat is a <br>cornerstone of the MIDS curriculum, designed to combine academic rigor with <br>practical skills development. Students participated in a  moot court-style <br>competition , aimed at sharpening essential skills for international dispute <br>settlement: analyzing facts and evidence, building legal strategies, crafting <br>arguments, and practicing oral advocacy under time pressure. The exercise also <br>fostered teamwork and collaboration, as students worked in claimant and <br>respondent teams under the guidance of experienced coaches.</p>  <p>On the first day, <br>students received case materials and spent the day strategizing and preparing <br>their oral arguments. The second day culminated in  oral pleadings before <br>tribunals composed of distinguished international practitioners , including <br>arbitrators and counsel from leading law firms and institutions:  <br>Vanessa Alarcon <br>Duvanel (King & Spalding), David Bonifacio <br>(Total),</p>  <p>Panagiotis Chalkias <br>(White & Case), Gabriele Miscia <br>(Swiss Arbitration Centre), Lukas Montoya (LKK),</p>  <p>Tomás Navarro <br>Blakemore (MLL), Giulio Palermo <br>(Archipel), Deepak Raju (Sidley <br>Austin),  Vincent Reynaud <br>(Lalive), Sebastiano Nessi <br>(Curtis). This unique <br>opportunity allowed students to experience the dynamics of real-world <br>arbitration hearings and receive valuable feedback from experts.  <br>Beyond the <br>competition, the retreat offered moments for networking and social interaction, <br>strengthening the bonds within the MIDS community. Participation in the retreat <br>is mandatory and forms part of the official MIDS transcript, reflecting its <br>importance in the program's holistic approach to education.</p>  <p>We extend our <br>gratitude to the esteemed members of the tribunals for their time and <br>expertise, and to all students for their dedication and professionalism. The <br>retreat exemplifies the MIDS commitment to combining theory with practice in an <br>immersive, collaborative environment.</p>
