      <p> </p>  <p>To <br>remain the world's leading program in international dispute resolution, MIDS continues <br>to evolve—not for novelty's sake, but to remain ahead of the curve. Several key <br>updates mark this new chapter: Substantive law <br>     at the core Essential <br>courses in investment law and international commercial contracts have been <br>added, led by Prof.  Jan Kleinheisterkamp  and Dr.  Dolores Bentolila . These <br>additions respond directly to practitioner feedback, emphasizing the importance <br>of fluency in the language of contracts. Comparative jurisdictions A <br>newly introduced trio of courses examines how England, France, and Switzerland <br>address challenges to arbitral awards. Taught by Dr.  Tariq Block KC , Prof. <br> Maximin de Fontmichel , and Dr.  Franz Stirnimann , this comparative approach <br>enhances understanding of key procedural differences. Tech and climate disputes New <br>offerings include cutting-edge courses on AI tools ( Dmitri Evseev ), IP and tech <br>arbitration (Prof.  Jacques de Werra ), and climate-related dispute mechanisms <br>(Prof.  Laurence Boisson de Chazournes ), equipping graduates for emerging <br>challenges in the field. Winter Arbitration Academy in Rome In <br>January 2026, ten leading arbitration partners will convene for a  week of mentorship and seminars in Rome  for our students. Outreach and events In <br>June, the MIDS co-hosted a  major conference on climate change and disputeresolution . Such events remain central to the program's mission, with <br>additional initiatives forthcoming.</p>  <p> MIDS <br>is changing - so it can remain exactly what it has always been: the gold standard <br>in international dispute resolution education.</p>  <p> Read more in  our latest newsletter  Explore more about one of the  top LL.M.
