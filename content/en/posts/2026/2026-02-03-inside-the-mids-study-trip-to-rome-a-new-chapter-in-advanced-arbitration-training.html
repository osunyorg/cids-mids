    Inside the MIDS Study Trip to Rome — A new chapter in advanced arbitration training Rome, 25–31 January 2026
  summary: >-
    <p>  Against the backdrop of Rome's historic avenues and vibrant legal community, the MIDS - Master in International Dispute Settlement - launched its first-ever study trip to the Italian capital, joining forces with the Luiss School of Law and the Centre for International Dispute Settlement (CIDS). Over the course of a week, MIDS students immersed themselves in a carefully tailored programme of advanced arbitration instruction, meaningful exchanges with top practitioners, and networking opportunities that spanned classrooms, law firm terraces, and one of Rome's most spectacular university campuses.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>"A different kind of classroom": A week designed for depth  <br>The Study Trip forms part of the MIDS' mission to expose students to the realities of international dispute settlement practice at the highest level. For many, the Rome experience was transformative not only academically but professionally. "This is a different kind of classroom," said Professor Zachary Douglas KC, who opened the Academy and conducted the twice-daily interviews with the visiting faculty. "The intimacy of the format allows a very direct engagement with the visiting faculty, who are all leaders in the international arbitration world and who forged their own original paths to the top.  They gave frank and sincere answers to the issues that preoccupy anyone starting out in the profession and then provided a masterclass on a substantive topic of their choice.  It was an intense week but hugely rewarding." Each session began with a conversation-style interview between Prof. Douglas and the guest lecturer - a setting students described as both rigorous and reassuringly candid.</p>  <p> Learning from the leaders shaping the field  <br>Over five days, students heard from ten leading arbitration practitioners representing international firms such as Freshfields, Cleary Gottlieb, White & Case, WilmerHale, Curtis, Bredin Prat and A&O Shearman, as well as from ICSID. Among the highlights:  <br> Dr. Andrea Carlevaris (BonelliErede):  Current issues under the New York Convention  <br>  <br> Irene Petrelli (Curtis):  Climate change and dispute resolution  <br>  <br> Dr. Lluis Paradell (Freshfields):  Effective arbitration advocacy  <br>  <br> Laura Bergamini (ICSID):  Behind the scenes of ICSID arbitration  <br>  <br> Zelda Hunter (White & Case):  Construction arbitration essentials  <br>  <br> Franz Schwarz (WilmerHale):  Quantifying damages in international disputes  <br>  <br> Laurie Achtouk-Spivak (Cleary Gottlieb):  Handling allegations of corruption  <br>  <br> Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero (Wordstone):  Arbitration involving States  <br>  <br> Jennifer Younan (A&O Shearman):  Reforming investment treaty arbitration  <br>  <br> Dr. Raëd Fathallah (Bredin Prat):  Scope of investment protection  <br>  <br> "The chance to discuss real strategic decisions with counsels who have built the field over decades was invaluable," said one MIDS participant. "What stood out most was the opportunity to engage directly with leading practitioners, ask meaningful questions, and exchange ideas with colleagues from across the global arbitration community"</p>  <p> Beyond the Classroom: Rome's legal community welcomes the MIDS </p>  <p>The collaborative spirit continued after class hours. On Monday and Wednesday, Freshfields and Cleary Gottlieb hosted an evening aperitif in its Rome offices, giving students the chance to exchange views with practitioners in an informal setting.   "Studying and networking in the heart of ancient Rome, a city that reflects centuries of legal and intellectual tradition, made this experience even more inspiring." highlighted another MIDS participant. </p>  <p> A powerful foundation for future careers  <br>For the MIDS cohort, the Rome Study Trip was more than an academic excursion - it was a formative step toward their future professional paths. "The study trip strengthened what makes the MIDS unique: an insider's perspective, excellence, and community," said Professor Douglas. "It gave our students direct access to the people and ideas shaping international arbitration today." Partners shared their insights into their recruitment practices and policies, highlighting their direct involvement in these processes and the importance of building a strong professional network. They also outlined prevailing hiring trends in the market and provided guidance on how to navigate them more effectively. The programme culminated in a gala dinner on the Thursday evening, where faculty and students enjoyed wonderful Italian cuisine and reflected on the week's insights over a spritz or two. </p>
