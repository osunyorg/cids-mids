    MIDS ALUMNI PORTRAIT SERIES — Charting a career in arbitration: A conversation with Lukas Innerebner
  summary: >-
    <p>  Lukas Innerebner, now a Senior Associate at Wartmann Merker in Zurich, discovered his passion for arbitration early in his legal career. Seeking both academic depth and international exposure, he joined the MIDS with high expectations-expectations he says were fully met. In this interview, Lukas reflects on the transformative impact of the program, the strength of the MIDS network, and the moments that continue to shape his professional journey. He also shares his thoughts on the evolution of international dispute resolution and offers insights for future students embarking on the same path.</p><p><b><i>This interview is part of our new MIDS Alumni Portrait Series, which each month showcases the diverse paths and perspectives of our graduates.</i></b>  </p>

    <p>What motivated you to join the MIDS program, and what were your expectations at the time? </p>  <p>During my traineeship in Italy, I worked on my first arbitration cases and was immediately intrigued. I could imagine pursuing a career in this field but felt the need to gain specialized knowledge and spend time abroad to broaden my professional horizon. The MIDS promised both an excellent academic program and a springboard for an internship abroad. My expectations were fully met!</p>  <p>  Which aspect of the MIDS experience had the greatest impact on your professional or personal growth?  <br>Even before mentioning the outstanding faculty and the various soft-skill trainings, I must highlight the exchange with my fabulous and incredibly smart classmates from the 2017/18 batch. I learned so much from them, professionally and personally.</p>  <p> How has the MIDS network or training influenced your career path since graduation?  <br>The MIDS network is exceptionally close-knit and creates a strong sense of shared identity. While the support of the MIDS Faculty helped me secure a traineeship in Switzerland, it is now primarily my peers with whom I collaborate on mandates and in the organization of events. The training in networking, public speaking, interviewing, legal writing, and oral advocacy equipped me with skills that have proven useful in countless professional situations; I would even say that I benefit from them on a daily basis.</p>  <p> Which moment since graduation made you realize the true value of your MIDS experience - and was it what you expected? </p>  <p>The MIDS Alumni Association Yearly Conference is always a highlight. Returning to Geneva, listening to brilliant colleagues, and reliving the friendly, collaborative atmosphere remind me of the exceptional education and network I gained at MIDS. It reinforces the lasting professional and personal value of the program, from the skills I acquired to the relationships I continue to cultivate. I always leave the conference with positive feelings, so in many ways, the experience has been more rewarding than I initially expected.</p>  <p>  If you could redesign one aspect of international dispute resolution, what would it be and why?  <br>In its early days, international dispute resolution was about resolving disputes in the noble sense, by finding constructive solutions. Today, the field has matured, which is undoubtedly positive, but it has also become a large industry. At times, lawyers lose sight of the fact that they can genuinely help parties reach a solution. I see room for a renewed focus on what truly supports parties in advancing their objectives, where a creative use of the many available forms of alternative dispute resolution could be particularly valuable.</p>  <p> Can you share a memorable moment or highlight from your year at the MIDS? </p>  <p>A major highlight was the general course with Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, Prof. Douglas, Prof. Kohen, and Prof. Boisson de Chazournes. It is rare to have such leading figures in international law dedicate so much time over several months to share their knowledge and insights.</p>  <p> What advice would you give to future MIDS students embarking on this journey? </p>  <p>Embrace the full MIDS experience: dedicate yourself to the academic program, but do not forget that there are friendships, opportunities, and unforgettable moments waiting for you beyond the classroom.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Check out Lukas's full profile <br>https://mids.ch/team/lukas-innerebner/</p>
