        <p>The unique strength of the MIDS is the combination of a common curriculum providing students with key, foundational knowledge, and a personalized curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in. Finally, the third pillar is formed by a set of "special activities" that allow for students to gain exposure to real-life aspects of the operation, in practice, of international dispute settlement.</p>

        <p>The groundwork of the curriculum consists of two general courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of international dispute settlement. The first course, held during the first semester, sets the stage and explains the different mechanisms for resolving international disputes. The second discusses the main procedural issues that arise in international legal proceedings.</p>
