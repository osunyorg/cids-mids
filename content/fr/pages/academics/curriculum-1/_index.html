        <p>The unique strength of the MIDS is the combination of a common curriculum providing students with key, foundational knowledge, and a personalized curriculum, allowing students to focus on specific areas they want to specialize in. Finally, the third pillar is formed by a set of "special activities" that allow for students to gain exposure to real-life aspects of the operation, in practice, of international dispute settlement.</p>

        <p>The groundwork of the curriculum consists of two general courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of international dispute settlement. The first course, held during the first semester, sets the stage and explains the different mechanisms for resolving international disputes. The second discusses the main procedural issues that arise in international legal proceedings.</p>

        <p>What types of situations give rise to disputes in the international arena? How are these different disputes settled? What dispute resolution mechanisms are available? The course will focus on in­vestment and commercial arbitration, ICJ and WTO dispute settlement procedures as well as on cer­ tain other contemporary dispute settlement mechanisms. The main characteristics of each dispute settlement institution and procedure will be examined, with emphasis put on the types of disputes that can be brought before each one as well as other relevant issues of jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>This course covers the main procedural issues arising in the inter­ national legal proceedings examined in the first general course. As the procedures in the different dispute resolution processes raise similar issues (e.g. jurisdiction, provisional remedies, equaltreatment, evidence, enforcement), this course reviews these aspects with an eye to comparisons and contrasts.</p>

        <p>Tutorials are intrinsically connected to the general courses. Inspired by the Oxford tutorial system, tutorials are weekly interactions between a tutor and a group of ten students. Tutorials serve two different purposes. On the one hand, they provide an opportunity for a revisit and more detailed exploration and illustration of the key concepts addressed in the general courses. On the other, in every tutorial session a student presents a research paper which is discussed with all participants.</p><p>Students are expected to participate actively during tutorials, not only in the discussion of the issues covered by the general courses, but also on the research papers presented by their classmates.</p>
