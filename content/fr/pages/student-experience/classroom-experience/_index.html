        <p>Being a good lawyer requires more than knowledge, skills and experience: it requires being a well-rounded, sensitive, open-minded, empathetic and collaborative individual. As such, for all the rigor, demands, and healthy dose of competition involved in the MIDS program, it is also meant to be a collaborative journey enabling students to develop their soft-skills and thrive together rather than against each other. This cooperative approach cultivates a supportive learning environment, encouraging the exchange of diverse perspectives and ideas, and fostering mutual growth. Through group projects, discussions, and networking opportunities, students develop essential teamwork skills, crucial for their future careers, and build lasting professional and personal relationships. </p>

        <p>Recent graduates often describe the MIDS as a marathon: an intense and sometimes challenging year-long experience, but ultimately an extremely rewarding one. While we do our utmost to make our students' time in Geneva as pleasant and smooth as possible, the program is designed to be immersive, rigorous and demanding, and we encourage prospective students to not underestimate the level of personal commitment it requires. However, with the constant support of our faculty, lecturers, and our experienced and attentive administrative team, this allows students to become the best version of themselves while preparing them for the challenges of international dispute resolution and legal careers.</p><p>Furthermore, in the face of the challenges and adversity that are unavoidable in a demanding academic program, our graduates always highlight the extraordinary strength and fulfilling nature of the lifelong bonds they form with each other while at the MIDS.<br></p>
